
I. THE STORY OF MY LIFE



CHAPTER I

It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life.
I have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that
clings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an
autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest
impressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that
link the past with the present. The woman paints the child's experiences
in her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first
years of my life; but "the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest."
Besides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their
poignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education
have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries. In order,
therefore, not to be tedious I shall try to present in a series of
sketches only the episodes that seem to me to be the most interesting
and important.

I was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a little town of northern
Alabama.

The family on my father's side is descended from Caspar Keller, a native
of Switzerland, who settled in Maryland. One of my Swiss ancestors was
the first teacher of the deaf in Zurich and wrote a book on the subject
of their education--rather a singular coincidence; though it is true
that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and
no slave who has not had a king among his.

My grandfather, Caspar Keller's son, "entered" large tracts of land in
Alabama and finally settled there. I have been told that once a year he
went from Tuscumbia to Philadelphia on horseback to purchase supplies
for the plantation, and my aunt has in her possession many of the
letters to his family, which give charming and vivid accounts of these
trips.

My Grandmother Keller was a daughter of one of Lafayette's aides,
Alexander Moore, and granddaughter of Alexander Spotswood, an early
Colonial Governor of Virginia. She was also second cousin to Robert E.
Lee.

My father, Arthur H. Keller, was a captain in the Confederate Army, and
my mother, Kate Adams, was his second wife and many years younger. Her
grandfather, Benjamin Adams, married Susanna E. Goodhue, and lived in
Newbury, Massachusetts, for many years. Their son, Charles Adams, was
born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and moved to Helena, Arkansas. When
the Civil War broke out, he fought on the side of the South and became
a brigadier-general. He married Lucy Helen Everett, who belonged to the
same family of Everetts as Edward Everett and Dr. Edward Everett Hale.
After the war was over the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.

I lived, up to the time of the illness that deprived me of my sight and
hearing, in a tiny house consisting of a large square room and a small
one, in which the servant slept. It is a custom in the South to build a
small house near the homestead as an annex to be used on occasion. Such
a house my father built after the Civil War, and when he married my
mother they went to live in it. It was completely covered with vines,
climbing roses and honeysuckles. From the garden it looked like an
arbour. The little porch was hidden from view by a screen of yellow
roses and Southern smilax. It was the favourite haunt of humming-birds
and bees.

The Keller homestead, where the family lived, was a few steps from our
little rose-bower. It was called "Ivy Green" because the house and the
surrounding trees and fences were covered with beautiful English ivy.
Its old-fashioned garden was the paradise of my childhood.

Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square
stiff boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell would find the
first violets and lilies. There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to
find comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and grass. What
joy it was to lose myself in that garden of flowers, to wander happily
from spot to spot, until, coming suddenly upon a beautiful vine, I
recognized it by its leaves and blossoms, and knew it was the vine which
covered the tumble-down summer-house at the farther end of the garden!
Here, also, were trailing clematis, drooping jessamine, and some rare
sweet flowers called butterfly lilies, because their fragile petals
resemble butterflies' wings. But the roses--they were loveliest of all.
Never have I found in the greenhouses of the North such heart-satisfying
roses as the climbing roses of my southern home. They used to hang
in long festoons from our porch, filling the whole air with their
fragrance, untainted by any earthy smell; and in the early morning,
washed in the dew, they felt so soft, so pure, I could not help
wondering if they did not resemble the asphodels of God's garden.

The beginning of my life was simple and much like every other little
life. I came, I saw, I conquered, as the first baby in the family always
does. There was the usual amount of discussion as to a name for me.
The first baby in the family was not to be lightly named, every one was
emphatic about that. My father suggested the name of Mildred Campbell,
an ancestor whom he highly esteemed, and he declined to take any further
part in the discussion. My mother solved the problem by giving it as
her wish that I should be called after her mother, whose maiden name was
Helen Everett. But in the excitement of carrying me to church my father
lost the name on the way, very naturally, since it was one in which he
had declined to have a part. When the minister asked him for it, he just
remembered that it had been decided to call me after my grandmother, and
he gave her name as Helen Adams.

I am told that while I was still in long dresses I showed many signs of
an eager, self-asserting disposition. Everything that I saw other people
do I insisted upon imitating. At six months I could pipe out "How d'ye,"
and one day I attracted every one's attention by saying "Tea, tea, tea"
quite plainly. Even after my illness I remembered one of the words I had
learned in these early months. It was the word "water," and I continued
to make some sound for that word after all other speech was lost. I
ceased making the sound "wah-wah" only when I learned to spell the word.

They tell me I walked the day I was a year old. My mother had just
taken me out of the bath-tub and was holding me in her lap, when I was
suddenly attracted by the flickering shadows of leaves that danced in
the sunlight on the smooth floor. I slipped from my mother's lap and
almost ran toward them. The impulse gone, I fell down and cried for her
to take me up in her arms.

These happy days did not last long. One brief spring, musical with the
song of robin and mocking-bird, one summer rich in fruit and roses, one
autumn of gold and crimson sped by and left their gifts at the feet of
an eager, delighted child. Then, in the dreary month of February,
came the illness which closed my eyes and ears and plunged me into the
unconsciousness of a new-born baby. They called it acute congestion of
the stomach and brain. The doctor thought I could not live. Early one
morning, however, the fever left me as suddenly and mysteriously as it
had come. There was great rejoicing in the family that morning, but no
one, not even the doctor, knew that I should never see or hear again.

I fancy I still have confused recollections of that illness. I
especially remember the tenderness with which my mother tried to soothe
me in my waling hours of fret and pain, and the agony and bewilderment
with which I awoke after a tossing half sleep, and turned my eyes, so
dry and hot, to the wall away from the once-loved light, which came
to me dim and yet more dim each day. But, except for these fleeting
memories, if, indeed, they be memories, it all seems very unreal, like
a nightmare. Gradually I got used to the silence and darkness that
surrounded me and forgot that it had ever been different, until she
came--my teacher--who was to set my spirit free. But during the first
nineteen months of my life I had caught glimpses of broad, green fields,
a luminous sky, trees and flowers which the darkness that followed could
not wholly blot out. If we have once seen, "the day is ours, and what
the day has shown."



CHAPTER II

I cannot recall what happened during the first months after my illness.
I only know that I sat in my mother's lap or clung to her dress as she
went about her household duties. My hands felt every object and observed
every motion, and in this way I learned to know many things. Soon I
felt the need of some communication with others and began to make crude
signs. A shake of the head meant "No" and a nod, "Yes," a pull meant
"Come" and a push, "Go." Was it bread that I wanted? Then I would
imitate the acts of cutting the slices and buttering them. If I wanted
my mother to make ice-cream for dinner I made the sign for working the
freezer and shivered, indicating cold. My mother, moreover, succeeded
in making me understand a good deal. I always knew when she wished me
to bring her something, and I would run upstairs or anywhere else she
indicated. Indeed, I owe to her loving wisdom all that was bright and
good in my long night.

I understood a good deal of what was going on about me. At five I
learned to fold and put away the clean clothes when they were brought
in from the laundry, and I distinguished my own from the rest. I knew
by the way my mother and aunt dressed when they were going out, and I
invariably begged to go with them. I was always sent for when there was
company, and when the guests took their leave, I waved my hand to them,
I think with a vague remembrance of the meaning of the gesture. One day
some gentlemen called on my mother, and I felt the shutting of the front
door and other sounds that indicated their arrival. On a sudden thought
I ran upstairs before any one could stop me, to put on my idea of a
company dress. Standing before the mirror, as I had seen others do, I
anointed mine head with oil and covered my face thickly with powder.
Then I pinned a veil over my head so that it covered my face and fell in
folds down to my shoulders, and tied an enormous bustle round my small
waist, so that it dangled behind, almost meeting the hem of my skirt.
Thus attired I went down to help entertain the company.

I do not remember when I first realized that I was different from other
people; but I knew it before my teacher came to me. I had noticed that
my mother and my friends did not use signs as I did when they wanted
anything done, but talked with their mouths. Sometimes I stood between
two persons who were conversing and touched their lips. I could not
understand, and was vexed. I moved my lips and gesticulated frantically
without result. This made me so angry at times that I kicked and
screamed until I was exhausted.

I think I knew when I was naughty, for I knew that it hurt Ella, my
nurse, to kick her, and when my fit of temper was over I had a feeling
akin to regret. But I cannot remember any instance in which this feeling
prevented me from repeating the naughtiness when I failed to get what I
wanted.

In those days a little coloured girl, Martha Washington, the child of
our cook, and Belle, an old setter, and a great hunter in her day, were
my constant companions. Martha Washington understood my signs, and I
seldom had any difficulty in making her do just as I wished. It pleased
me to domineer over her, and she generally submitted to my tyranny
rather than risk a hand-to-hand encounter. I was strong, active,
indifferent to consequences. I knew my own mind well enough and always
had my own way, even if I had to fight tooth and nail for it. We spent
a great deal of time in the kitchen, kneading dough balls, helping make
ice-cream, grinding coffee, quarreling over the cake-bowl, and feeding
the hens and turkeys that swarmed about the kitchen steps. Many of them
were so tame that they would eat from my hand and let me feel them.
One big gobbler snatched a tomato from me one day and ran away with it.
Inspired, perhaps, by Master Gobbler's success, we carried off to the
woodpile a cake which the cook had just frosted, and ate every bit of
it. I was quite ill afterward, and I wonder if retribution also overtook
the turkey.

The guinea-fowl likes to hide her nest in out-of-the-way places, and it
was one of my greatest delights to hunt for the eggs in the long grass.
I could not tell Martha Washington when I wanted to go egg-hunting,
but I would double my hands and put them on the ground, which meant
something round in the grass, and Martha always understood. When we were
fortunate enough to find a nest I never allowed her to carry the eggs
home, making her understand by emphatic signs that she might fall and
break them.

The sheds where the corn was stored, the stable where the horses were
kept, and the yard where the cows were milked morning and evening were
unfailing sources of interest to Martha and me. The milkers would let
me keep my hands on the cows while they milked, and I often got well
switched by the cow for my curiosity.

The making ready for Christmas was always a delight to me. Of course I
did not know what it was all about, but I enjoyed the pleasant odours
that filled the house and the tidbits that were given to Martha
Washington and me to keep us quiet. We were sadly in the way, but that
did not interfere with our pleasure in the least. They allowed us to
grind the spices, pick over the raisins and lick the stirring spoons.
I hung my stocking because the others did; I cannot remember, however,
that the ceremony interested me especially, nor did my curiosity cause
me to wake before daylight to look for my gifts.

Martha Washington had as great a love of mischief as I. Two little
children were seated on the veranda steps one hot July afternoon.
One was black as ebony, with little bunches of fuzzy hair tied with
shoestrings sticking out all over her head like corkscrews. The other
was white, with long golden curls. One child was six years old, the
other two or three years older. The younger child was blind--that was
I--and the other was Martha Washington. We were busy cutting out paper
dolls; but we soon wearied of this amusement, and after cutting up our
shoestrings and clipping all the leaves off the honeysuckle that were
within reach, I turned my attention to Martha's corkscrews. She objected
at first, but finally submitted. Thinking that turn and turn about is
fair play, she seized the scissors and cut off one of my curls, and
would have cut them all off but for my mother's timely interference.

Belle, our dog, my other companion, was old and lazy and liked to sleep
by the open fire rather than to romp with me. I tried hard to teach
her my sign language, but she was dull and inattentive. She sometimes
started and quivered with excitement, then she became perfectly rigid,
as dogs do when they point a bird. I did not then know why Belle acted
in this way; but I knew she was not doing as I wished. This vexed me and
the lesson always ended in a one-sided boxing match. Belle would get up,
stretch herself lazily, give one or two contemptuous sniffs, go to
the opposite side of the hearth and lie down again, and I, wearied and
disappointed, went off in search of Martha.

Many incidents of those early years are fixed in my memory, isolated,
but clear and distinct, making the sense of that silent, aimless,
dayless life all the more intense.

One day I happened to spill water on my apron, and I spread it out to
dry before the fire which was flickering on the sitting-room hearth. The
apron did not dry quickly enough to suit me, so I drew nearer and threw
it right over the hot ashes. The fire leaped into life; the flames
encircled me so that in a moment my clothes were blazing. I made a
terrified noise that brought Viny, my old nurse, to the rescue. Throwing
a blanket over me, she almost suffocated me, but she put out the fire.
Except for my hands and hair I was not badly burned.

About this time I found out the use of a key. One morning I locked my
mother up in the pantry, where she was obliged to remain three hours, as
the servants were in a detached part of the house. She kept pounding on
the door, while I sat outside on the porch steps and laughed with glee
as I felt the jar of the pounding. This most naughty prank of mine
convinced my parents that I must be taught as soon as possible. After
my teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to me, I sought an early opportunity
to lock her in her room. I went upstairs with something which my mother
made me understand I was to give to Miss Sullivan; but no sooner had I
given it to her than I slammed the door to, locked it, and hid the key
under the wardrobe in the hall. I could not be induced to tell where the
key was. My father was obliged to get a ladder and take Miss Sullivan
out through the window--much to my delight. Months after I produced the
key.

When I was about five years old we moved from the little vine-covered
house to a large new one. The family consisted of my father and mother,
two older half-brothers, and, afterward, a little sister, Mildred. My
earliest distinct recollection of my father is making my way through
great drifts of newspapers to his side and finding him alone, holding
a sheet of paper before his face. I was greatly puzzled to know what he
was doing. I imitated this action, even wearing his spectacles, thinking
they might help solve the mystery. But I did not find out the secret for
several years. Then I learned what those papers were, and that my father
edited one of them.

My father was most loving and indulgent, devoted to his home, seldom
leaving us, except in the hunting season. He was a great hunter, I have
been told, and a celebrated shot. Next to his family he loved his dogs
and gun. His hospitality was great, almost to a fault, and he seldom
came home without bringing a guest. His special pride was the big garden
where, it was said, he raised the finest watermelons and strawberries in
the county; and to me he brought the first ripe grapes and the choicest
berries. I remember his caressing touch as he led me from tree to tree,
from vine to vine, and his eager delight in whatever pleased me.

He was a famous story-teller; after I had acquired language he used to
spell clumsily into my hand his cleverest anecdotes, and nothing pleased
him more than to have me repeat them at an opportune moment.

I was in the North, enjoying the last beautiful days of the summer of
1896, when I heard the news of my father's death. He had had a short
illness, there had been a brief time of acute suffering, then all was
over. This was my first great sorrow--my first personal experience with
death.

How shall I write of my mother? She is so near to me that it almost
seems indelicate to speak of her.

For a long time I regarded my little sister as an intruder. I knew that
I had ceased to be my mother's only darling, and the thought filled me
with jealousy. She sat in my mother's lap constantly, where I used to
sit, and seemed to take up all her care and time. One day something
happened which seemed to me to be adding insult to injury.

At that time I had a much-petted, much-abused doll, which I afterward
named Nancy. She was, alas, the helpless victim of my outbursts of
temper and of affection, so that she became much the worse for wear. I
had dolls which talked, and cried, and opened and shut their eyes; yet
I never loved one of them as I loved poor Nancy. She had a cradle, and I
often spent an hour or more rocking her. I guarded both doll and cradle
with the most jealous care; but once I discovered my little sister
sleeping peacefully in the cradle. At this presumption on the part of
one to whom as yet no tie of love bound me I grew angry. I rushed upon
the cradle and over-turned it, and the baby might have been killed had
my mother not caught her as she fell. Thus it is that when we walk in
the valley of twofold solitude we know little of the tender affections
that grow out of endearing words and actions and companionship. But
afterward, when I was restored to my human heritage, Mildred and I grew
into each other's hearts, so that we were content to go hand-in-hand
wherever caprice led us, although she could not understand my finger
language, nor I her childish prattle.



CHAPTER III

Meanwhile the desire to express myself grew. The few signs I used became
less and less adequate, and my failures to make myself understood were
invariably followed by outbursts of passion. I felt as if invisible
hands were holding me, and I made frantic efforts to free myself.
I struggled--not that struggling helped matters, but the spirit of
resistance was strong within me; I generally broke down in tears and
physical exhaustion. If my mother happened to be near I crept into her
arms, too miserable even to remember the cause of the tempest. After
awhile the need of some means of communication became so urgent that
these outbursts occurred daily, sometimes hourly.

My parents were deeply grieved and perplexed. We lived a long way from
any school for the blind or the deaf, and it seemed unlikely that any
one would come to such an out-of-the-way place as Tuscumbia to teach
a child who was both deaf and blind. Indeed, my friends and relatives
sometimes doubted whether I could be taught. My mother's only ray of
hope came from Dickens's "American Notes." She had read his account of
Laura Bridgman, and remembered vaguely that she was deaf and blind, yet
had been educated. But she also remembered with a hopeless pang that Dr.
Howe, who had discovered the way to teach the deaf and blind, had been
dead many years. His methods had probably died with him; and if they had
not, how was a little girl in a far-off town in Alabama to receive the
benefit of them?

When I was about six years old, my father heard of an eminent oculist
in Baltimore, who had been successful in many cases that had seemed
hopeless. My parents at once determined to take me to Baltimore to see
if anything could be done for my eyes.

The journey, which I remember well was very pleasant. I made friends
with many people on the train. One lady gave me a box of shells. My
father made holes in these so that I could string them, and for a long
time they kept me happy and contented. The conductor, too, was kind.
Often when he went his rounds I clung to his coat tails while he
collected and punched the tickets. His punch, with which he let me play,
was a delightful toy. Curled up in a corner of the seat I amused myself
for hours making funny little holes in bits of cardboard.

My aunt made me a big doll out of towels. It was the most comical
shapeless thing, this improvised doll, with no nose, mouth, ears or
eyes--nothing that even the imagination of a child could convert into a
face. Curiously enough, the absence of eyes struck me more than all
the other defects put together. I pointed this out to everybody with
provoking persistency, but no one seemed equal to the task of providing
the doll with eyes. A bright idea, however, shot into my mind, and the
problem was solved. I tumbled off the seat and searched under it until
I found my aunt's cape, which was trimmed with large beads. I pulled two
beads off and indicated to her that I wanted her to sew them on my
doll. She raised my hand to her eyes in a questioning way, and I nodded
energetically. The beads were sewed in the right place and I could not
contain myself for joy; but immediately I lost all interest in the doll.
During the whole trip I did not have one fit of temper, there were so
many things to keep my mind and fingers busy.

When we arrived in Baltimore, Dr. Chisholm received us kindly: but
he could do nothing. He said, however, that I could be educated, and
advised my father to consult Dr. Alexander Graham Bell of Washington,
who would be able to give him information about schools and teachers
of deaf or blind children. Acting on the doctor's advice, we went
immediately to Washington to see Dr. Bell, my father with a sad heart
and many misgivings, I wholly unconscious of his anguish, finding
pleasure in the excitement of moving from place to place. Child as I
was, I at once felt the tenderness and sympathy which endeared Dr.
Bell to so many hearts, as his wonderful achievements enlist their
admiration. He held me on his knee while I examined his watch, and he
made it strike for me. He understood my signs, and I knew it and loved
him at once. But I did not dream that that interview would be the door
through which I should pass from darkness into light, from isolation to
friendship, companionship, knowledge, love.

Dr. Bell advised my father to write to Mr. Anagnos, director of the
Perkins Institution in Boston, the scene of Dr. Howe's great labours
for the blind, and ask him if he had a teacher competent to begin my
education. This my father did at once, and in a few weeks there came
a kind letter from Mr. Anagnos with the comforting assurance that
a teacher had been found. This was in the summer of 1886. But Miss
Sullivan did not arrive until the following March.

Thus I came up out of Egypt and stood before Sinai, and a power divine
touched my spirit and gave it sight, so that I beheld many wonders. And
from the sacred mountain I heard a voice which said, "Knowledge is love
and light and vision."



CHAPTER IV

The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my
teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder
when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which
it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was
seven years old.

On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb,
expectant. I guessed vaguely from my mother's signs and from the
hurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to
happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun
penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch, and fell
on my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the
familiar leaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the
sweet southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or
surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for
weeks and a deep languor had succeeded this passionate struggle.

Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a
tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and
anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line,
and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like
that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or
sounding-line, and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was.
"Light! give me light!" was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light
of love shone on me in that very hour.

I felt approaching footsteps, I stretched out my hand as I supposed to
my mother. Some one took it, and I was caught up and held close in the
arms of her who had come to reveal all things to me, and, more than all
things else, to love me.

The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me
a doll. The little blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent
it and Laura Bridgman had dressed it; but I did not know this until
afterward. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan
slowly spelled into my hand the word "d-o-l-l." I was at once interested
in this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded
in making the letters correctly I was flushed with childish pleasure and
pride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the
letters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even
that words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like
imitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this
uncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and
a few verbs like sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me
several weeks before I understood that everything has a name.

One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my
big rag doll into my lap also, spelled "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me
understand that "d-o-l-l" applied to both. Earlier in the day we had had
a tussle over the words "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-r." Miss Sullivan had tried
to impress it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water,
but I persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had dropped
the subject for the time, only to renew it at the first opportunity. I
became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the new doll,
I dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the
fragments of the broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret
followed my passionate outburst. I had not loved the doll. In the still,
dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or tenderness.
I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I
had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was
removed. She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm
sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought,
made me hop and skip with pleasure.

We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance
of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water
and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed
over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly,
then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions
of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something
forgotten--a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of
language was revealed to me. I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the
wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living
word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were
barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time be swept
away.

I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each
name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every
object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because
I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On
entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way
to the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them
together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what I had
done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.

I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they
all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among
them--words that were to make the world blossom for me, "like Aaron's
rod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a happier child
than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and
lived over the joys it had brought me, and for the first time longed for
a new day to come.



CHAPTER V

I recall many incidents of the summer of 1887 that followed my soul's
sudden awakening. I did nothing but explore with my hands and learn the
name of every object that I touched; and the more I handled things and
learned their names and uses, the more joyous and confident grew my
sense of kinship with the rest of the world.

When the time of daisies and buttercups came Miss Sullivan took me by
the hand across the fields, where men were preparing the earth for the
seed, to the banks of the Tennessee River, and there, sitting on the
warm grass, I had my first lessons in the beneficence of nature. I
learned how the sun and the rain make to grow out of the ground every
tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, how birds build
their nests and live and thrive from land to land, how the squirrel, the
deer, the lion and every other creature finds food and shelter. As my
knowledge of things grew I felt more and more the delight of the world I
was in. Long before I learned to do a sum in arithmetic or describe the
shape of the earth, Miss Sullivan had taught me to find beauty in the
fragrant woods, in every blade of grass, and in the curves and dimples
of my baby sister's hand. She linked my earliest thoughts with nature,
and made me feel that "birds and flowers and I were happy peers."

But about this time I had an experience which taught me that nature is
not always kind. One day my teacher and I were returning from a long
ramble. The morning had been fine, but it was growing warm and sultry
when at last we turned our faces homeward. Two or three times we stopped
to rest under a tree by the wayside. Our last halt was under a wild
cherry tree a short distance from the house. The shade was grateful, and
the tree was so easy to climb that with my teacher's assistance I was
able to scramble to a seat in the branches. It was so cool up in the
tree that Miss Sullivan proposed that we have our luncheon there. I
promised to keep still while she went to the house to fetch it.

Suddenly a change passed over the tree. All the sun's warmth left the
air. I knew the sky was black, because all the heat, which meant light
to me, had died out of the atmosphere. A strange odour came up from the
earth. I knew it, it was the odour that always precedes a thunderstorm,
and a nameless fear clutched at my heart. I felt absolutely alone,
cut off from my friends and the firm earth. The immense, the unknown,
enfolded me. I remained still and expectant; a chilling terror crept
over me. I longed for my teacher's return; but above all things I wanted
to get down from that tree.

There was a moment of sinister silence, then a multitudinous stirring
of the leaves. A shiver ran through the tree, and the wind sent forth a
blast that would have knocked me off had I not clung to the branch with
might and main. The tree swayed and strained. The small twigs snapped
and fell about me in showers. A wild impulse to jump seized me, but
terror held me fast. I crouched down in the fork of the tree. The
branches lashed about me. I felt the intermittent jarring that came now
and then, as if something heavy had fallen and the shock had traveled
up till it reached the limb I sat on. It worked my suspense up to the
highest point, and just as I was thinking the tree and I should fall
together, my teacher seized my hand and helped me down. I clung to her,
trembling with joy to feel the earth under my feet once more. I had
learned a new lesson--that nature "wages open war against her children,
and under softest touch hides treacherous claws."

After this experience it was a long time before I climbed another tree.
The mere thought filled me with terror. It was the sweet allurement
of the mimosa tree in full bloom that finally overcame my fears. One
beautiful spring morning when I was alone in the summer-house, reading,
I became aware of a wonderful subtle fragrance in the air. I started up
and instinctively stretched out my hands. It seemed as if the spirit of
spring had passed through the summer-house. "What is it?" I asked, and
the next minute I recognized the odour of the mimosa blossoms. I felt my
way to the end of the garden, knowing that the mimosa tree was near the
fence, at the turn of the path. Yes, there it was, all quivering in
the warm sunshine, its blossom-laden branches almost touching the long
grass. Was there ever anything so exquisitely beautiful in the world
before! Its delicate blossoms shrank from the slightest earthly touch;
it seemed as if a tree of paradise had been transplanted to earth. I
made my way through a shower of petals to the great trunk and for
one minute stood irresolute; then, putting my foot in the broad space
between the forked branches, I pulled myself up into the tree. I had
some difficulty in holding on, for the branches were very large and
the bark hurt my hands. But I had a delicious sense that I was doing
something unusual and wonderful so I kept on climbing higher and higher,
until I reached a little seat which somebody had built there so long ago
that it had grown part of the tree itself. I sat there for a long, long
time, feeling like a fairy on a rosy cloud. After that I spent many
happy hours in my tree of paradise, thinking fair thoughts and dreaming
bright dreams.



CHAPTER VI

I had now the key to all language, and I was eager to learn to use it.
Children who hear acquire language without any particular effort; the
words that fall from others' lips they catch on the wing, as it were,
delightedly, while the little deaf child must trap them by a slow
and often painful process. But whatever the process, the result is
wonderful. Gradually from naming an object we advance step by step until
we have traversed the vast distance between our first stammered syllable
and the sweep of thought in a line of Shakespeare.

At first, when my teacher told me about a new thing I asked very few
questions. My ideas were vague, and my vocabulary was inadequate; but as
my knowledge of things grew, and I learned more and more words, my field
of inquiry broadened, and I would return again and again to the same
subject, eager for further information. Sometimes a new word revived an
image that some earlier experience had engraved on my brain.

I remember the morning that I first asked the meaning of the word,
"love." This was before I knew many words. I had found a few early
violets in the garden and brought them to my teacher. She tried to kiss
me: but at that time I did not like to have any one kiss me except my
mother. Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my
hand, "I love Helen."

"What is love?" I asked.

She drew me closer to her and said, "It is here," pointing to my heart,
whose beats I was conscious of for the first time. Her words puzzled me
very much because I did not then understand anything unless I touched
it.

I smelt the violets in her hand and asked, half in words, half in signs,
a question which meant, "Is love the sweetness of flowers?"

"No," said my teacher.

Again I thought. The warm sun was shining on us.

"Is this not love?" I asked, pointing in the direction from which the
heat came. "Is this not love?"

It seemed to me that there could be nothing more beautiful than the sun,
whose warmth makes all things grow. But Miss Sullivan shook her head,
and I was greatly puzzled and disappointed. I thought it strange that my
teacher could not show me love.

A day or two afterward I was stringing beads of different sizes in
symmetrical groups--two large beads, three small ones, and so on. I had
made many mistakes, and Miss Sullivan had pointed them out again and
again with gentle patience. Finally I noticed a very obvious error
in the sequence and for an instant I concentrated my attention on the
lesson and tried to think how I should have arranged the beads. Miss
Sullivan touched my forehead and spelled with decided emphasis, "Think."

In a flash I knew that the word was the name of the process that was
going on in my head. This was my first conscious perception of an
abstract idea.

For a long time I was still--I was not thinking of the beads in my lap,
but trying to find a meaning for "love" in the light of this new
idea. The sun had been under a cloud all day, and there had been brief
showers; but suddenly the sun broke forth in all its southern splendour.

Again I asked my teacher, "Is this not love?"

"Love is something like the clouds that were in the sky before the sun
came out," she replied. Then in simpler words than these, which at that
time I could not have understood, she explained: "You cannot touch the
clouds, you know; but you feel the rain and know how glad the flowers
and the thirsty earth are to have it after a hot day. You cannot touch
love either; but you feel the sweetness that it pours into everything.
Without love you would not be happy or want to play."

The beautiful truth burst upon my mind--I felt that there were invisible
lines stretched between my spirit and the spirits of others.

From the beginning of my education Miss Sullivan made it a practice to
speak to me as she would speak to any hearing child; the only difference
was that she spelled the sentences into my hand instead of speaking
them. If I did not know the words and idioms necessary to express my
thoughts she supplied them, even suggesting conversation when I was
unable to keep up my end of the dialogue.

This process was continued for several years; for the deaf child does
not learn in a month, or even in two or three years, the numberless
idioms and expressions used in the simplest daily intercourse.
The little hearing child learns these from constant repetition and
imitation. The conversation he hears in his home stimulates his mind and
suggests topics and calls forth the spontaneous expression of his own
thoughts. This natural exchange of ideas is denied to the deaf child.
My teacher, realizing this, determined to supply the kinds of stimulus
I lacked. This she did by repeating to me as far as possible, verbatim,
what she heard, and by showing me how I could take part in the
conversation. But it was a long time before I ventured to take the
initiative, and still longer before I could find something appropriate
to say at the right time.

The deaf and the blind find it very difficult to acquire the amenities
of conversation. How much more this difficulty must be augmented in the
case of those who are both deaf and blind! They cannot distinguish the
tone of the voice or, without assistance, go up and down the gamut of
tones that give significance to words; nor can they watch the expression
of the speaker's face, and a look is often the very soul of what one
says.



CHAPTER VII

The next important step in my education was learning to read.

As soon as I could spell a few words my teacher gave me slips of
cardboard on which were printed words in raised letters. I quickly
learned that each printed word stood for an object, an act, or a
quality. I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little
sentences; but before I ever put sentences in the frame I used to make
them in objects. I found the slips of paper which represented, for
example, "doll," "is," "on," "bed" and placed each name on its object;
then I put my doll on the bed with the words is, on, bed arranged beside
the doll, thus making a sentence of the words, and at the same time
carrying out the idea of the sentence with the things themselves.

One day, Miss Sullivan tells me, I pinned the word girl on my pinafore
and stood in the wardrobe. On the shelf I arranged the words, is, in,
wardrobe. Nothing delighted me so much as this game. My teacher and I
played it for hours at a time. Often everything in the room was arranged
in object sentences.

From the printed slip it was but a step to the printed book. I took my
"Reader for Beginners" and hunted for the words I knew; when I found
them my joy was like that of a game of hide-and-seek. Thus I began to
read. Of the time when I began to read connected stories I shall speak
later.

For a long time I had no regular lessons. Even when I studied most
earnestly it seemed more like play than work. Everything Miss Sullivan
taught me she illustrated by a beautiful story or a poem. Whenever
anything delighted or interested me she talked it over with me just
as if she were a little girl herself. What many children think of with
dread, as a painful plodding through grammar, hard sums and harder
definitions, is to-day one of my most precious memories.

I cannot explain the peculiar sympathy Miss Sullivan had with my
pleasures and desires. Perhaps it was the result of long association
with the blind. Added to this she had a wonderful faculty for
description. She went quickly over uninteresting details, and
never nagged me with questions to see if I remembered the
day-before-yesterday's lesson. She introduced dry technicalities of
science little by little, making every subject so real that I could not
help remembering what she taught.

We read and studied out of doors, preferring the sunlit woods to the
house. All my early lessons have in them the breath of the woods--the
fine, resinous odour of pine needles, blended with the perfume of wild
grapes. Seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree, I learned to
think that everything has a lesson and a suggestion. "The loveliness of
things taught me all their use." Indeed, everything that could hum, or
buzz, or sing, or bloom had a part in my education-noisy-throated
frogs, katydids and crickets held in my hand until forgetting their
embarrassment, they trilled their reedy note, little downy chickens
and wildflowers, the dogwood blossoms, meadow-violets and budding fruit
trees. I felt the bursting cotton-bolls and fingered their soft fiber
and fuzzy seeds; I felt the low soughing of the wind through the
cornstalks, the silky rustling of the long leaves, and the indignant
snort of my pony, as we caught him in the pasture and put the bit in
his mouth--ah me! how well I remember the spicy, clovery smell of his
breath!

Sometimes I rose at dawn and stole into the garden while the heavy dew
lay on the grass and flowers. Few know what joy it is to feel the roses
pressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful motion of the lilies
as they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an insect in the
flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings
rubbed together in a sudden terror, as the little creature became aware
of a pressure from without.

Another favourite haunt of mine was the orchard, where the fruit ripened
early in July. The large, downy peaches would reach themselves into my
hand, and as the joyous breezes flew about the trees the apples tumbled
at my feet. Oh, the delight with which I gathered up the fruit in my
pinafore, pressed my face against the smooth cheeks of the apples, still
warm from the sun, and skipped back to the house!

Our favourite walk was to Keller's Landing, an old tumbledown
lumber-wharf on the Tennessee River, used during the Civil War to
land soldiers. There we spent many happy hours and played at learning
geography. I built dams of pebbles, made islands and lakes, and dug
river-beds, all for fun, and never dreamed that I was learning a lesson.
I listened with increasing wonder to Miss Sullivan's descriptions of
the great round world with its burning mountains, buried cities, moving
rivers of ice, and many other things as strange. She made raised maps in
clay, so that I could feel the mountain ridges and valleys, and follow
with my fingers the devious course of rivers. I liked this, too; but the
division of the earth into zones and poles confused and teased my mind.
The illustrative strings and the orange stick representing the poles
seemed so real that even to this day the mere mention of temperate zone
suggests a series of twine circles; and I believe that if any one should
set about it he could convince me that white bears actually climb the
North Pole.

Arithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like. From the
first I was not interested in the science of numbers. Miss Sullivan
tried to teach me to count by stringing beads in groups, and by
arranging kintergarten straws I learned to add and subtract. I never had
patience to arrange more than five or six groups at a time. When I had
accomplished this my conscience was at rest for the day, and I went out
quickly to find my playmates.

In this same leisurely manner I studied zoology and botany.

Once a gentleman, whose name I have forgotten, sent me a collection of
fossils--tiny mollusk shells beautifully marked, and bits of sandstone
with the print of birds' claws, and a lovely fern in bas-relief. These
were the keys which unlocked the treasures of the antediluvian world for
me. With trembling fingers I listened to Miss Sullivan's descriptions
of the terrible beasts, with uncouth, unpronounceable names, which once
went tramping through the primeval forests, tearing down the branches
of gigantic trees for food, and died in the dismal swamps of an unknown
age. For a long time these strange creatures haunted my dreams, and this
gloomy period formed a somber background to the joyous Now, filled with
sunshine and roses and echoing with the gentle beat of my pony's hoof.

Another time a beautiful shell was given me, and with a child's surprise
and delight I learned how a tiny mollusk had built the lustrous coil
for his dwelling place, and how on still nights, when there is no breeze
stirring the waves, the Nautilus sails on the blue waters of the
Indian Ocean in his "ship of pearl." After I had learned a great many
interesting things about the life and habits of the children of the
sea--how in the midst of dashing waves the little polyps build the
beautiful coral isles of the Pacific, and the foraminifera have made the
chalk-hills of many a land--my teacher read me "The Chambered Nautilus,"
and showed me that the shell-building process of the mollusks is
symbolical of the development of the mind. Just as the wonder-working
mantle of the Nautilus changes the material it absorbs from the water
and makes it a part of itself, so the bits of knowledge one gathers
undergo a similar change and become pearls of thought.

Again, it was the growth of a plant that furnished the text for a
lesson. We bought a lily and set it in a sunny window. Very soon the
green, pointed buds showed signs of opening. The slender, fingerlike
leaves on the outside opened slowly, reluctant, I thought, to reveal
the loveliness they hid; once having made a start, however, the opening
process went on rapidly, but in order and systematically. There was
always one bud larger and more beautiful than the rest, which pushed
her outer, covering back with more pomp, as if the beauty in soft, silky
robes knew that she was the lily-queen by right divine, while her more
timid sisters doffed their green hoods shyly, until the whole plant was
one nodding bough of loveliness and fragrance.

Once there were eleven tadpoles in a glass globe set in a window full
of plants. I remember the eagerness with which I made discoveries about
them. It was great fun to plunge my hand into the bowl and feel the
tadpoles frisk about, and to let them slip and slide between my fingers.
One day a more ambitious fellow leaped beyond the edge of the bowl and
fell on the floor, where I found him to all appearance more dead than
alive. The only sign of life was a slight wriggling of his tail. But
no sooner had he returned to his element than he darted to the bottom,
swimming round and round in joyous activity. He had made his leap, he
had seen the great world, and was content to stay in his pretty glass
house under the big fuchsia tree until he attained the dignity of
froghood. Then he went to live in the leafy pool at the end of the
garden, where he made the summer nights musical with his quaint
love-song.

Thus I learned from life itself. At the beginning I was only a little
mass of possibilities. It was my teacher who unfolded and developed
them. When she came, everything about me breathed of love and joy and
was full of meaning. She has never since let pass an opportunity to
point out the beauty that is in everything, nor has she ceased trying in
thought and action and example to make my life sweet and useful.

It was my teacher's genius, her quick sympathy, her loving tact which
made the first years of my education so beautiful. It was because she
seized the right moment to impart knowledge that made it so pleasant
and acceptable to me. She realized that a child's mind is like a shallow
brook which ripples and dances merrily over the stony course of its
education and reflects here a flower, there a bush, yonder a fleecy
cloud; and she attempted to guide my mind on its way, knowing that like
a brook it should be fed by mountain streams and hidden springs, until
it broadened out into a deep river, capable of reflecting in its placid
surface, billowy hills, the luminous shadows of trees and the blue
heavens, as well as the sweet face of a little flower.

Any teacher can take a child to the classroom, but not every teacher can
make him learn. He will not work joyously unless he feels that liberty
is his, whether he is busy or at rest; he must feel the flush of victory
and the heart-sinking of disappointment before he takes with a will the
tasks distasteful to him and resolves to dance his way bravely through a
dull routine of textbooks.

My teacher is so near to me that I scarcely think of myself apart from
her. How much of my delight in all beautiful things is innate, and how
much is due to her influence, I can never tell. I feel that her being is
inseparable from my own, and that the footsteps of my life are in
hers. All the best of me belongs to her--there is not a talent, or
an aspiration or a joy in me that has not been awakened by her loving
touch.



CHAPTER VIII

The first Christmas after Miss Sullivan came to Tuscumbia was a great
event. Every one in the family prepared surprises for me, but what
pleased me most, Miss Sullivan and I prepared surprises for everybody
else. The mystery that surrounded the gifts was my greatest delight and
amusement. My friends did all they could to excite my curiosity by hints
and half-spelled sentences which they pretended to break off in the nick
of time. Miss Sullivan and I kept up a game of guessing which taught
me more about the use of language than any set lessons could have done.
Every evening, seated round a glowing wood fire, we played our guessing
game, which grew more and more exciting as Christmas approached.

On Christmas Eve the Tuscumbia schoolchildren had their tree, to which
they invited me. In the centre of the schoolroom stood a beautiful
tree ablaze and shimmering in the soft light, its branches loaded with
strange, wonderful fruit. It was a moment of supreme happiness. I danced
and capered round the tree in an ecstasy. When I learned that there
was a gift for each child, I was delighted, and the kind people who had
prepared the tree permitted me to hand the presents to the children. In
the pleasure of doing this, I did not stop to look at my own gifts; but
when I was ready for them, my impatience for the real Christmas to begin
almost got beyond control. I knew the gifts I already had were not those
of which friends had thrown out such tantalizing hints, and my teacher
said the presents I was to have would be even nicer than these. I was
persuaded, however, to content myself with the gifts from the tree and
leave the others until morning.

That night, after I had hung my stocking, I lay awake a long time,
pretending to be asleep and keeping alert to see what Santa Claus would
do when he came. At last I fell asleep with a new doll and a white bear
in my arms. Next morning it was I who waked the whole family with my
first "Merry Christmas!" I found surprises, not in the stocking
only, but on the table, on all the chairs, at the door, on the very
window-sill; indeed, I could hardly walk without stumbling on a bit of
Christmas wrapped up in tissue paper. But when my teacher presented me
with a canary, my cup of happiness overflowed.

Little Tim was so tame that he would hop on my finger and eat candied
cherries out of my hand. Miss Sullivan taught me to take all the care of
my new pet. Every morning after breakfast I prepared his bath, made his
cage clean and sweet, filled his cups with fresh seed and water from the
well-house, and hung a spray of chickweed in his swing.

One morning I left the cage on the window-seat while I went to fetch
water for his bath. When I returned I felt a big cat brush past me as I
opened the door. At first I did not realize what had happened; but when
I put my hand in the cage and Tim's pretty wings did not meet my touch
or his small pointed claws take hold of my finger, I knew that I should
never see my sweet little singer again.



CHAPTER IX

The next important event in my life was my visit to Boston, in May,
1888. As if it were yesterday I remember the preparations, the departure
with my teacher and my mother, the journey, and finally the arrival
in Boston. How different this journey was from the one I had made to
Baltimore two years before! I was no longer a restless, excitable little
creature, requiring the attention of everybody on the train to keep
me amused. I sat quietly beside Miss Sullivan, taking in with eager
interest all that she told me about what she saw out of the car window:
the beautiful Tennessee River, the great cotton-fields, the hills and
woods, and the crowds of laughing negroes at the stations, who waved to
the people on the train and brought delicious candy and popcorn balls
through the car. On the seat opposite me sat my big rag doll, Nancy, in
a new gingham dress and a beruffled sunbonnet, looking at me out of
two bead eyes. Sometimes, when I was not absorbed in Miss Sullivan's
descriptions, I remembered Nancy's existence and took her up in my arms,
but I generally calmed my conscience by making myself believe that she
was asleep.

As I shall not have occasion to refer to Nancy again, I wish to tell
here a sad experience she had soon after our arrival in Boston. She was
covered with dirt--the remains of mud pies I had compelled her to eat,
although she had never shown any special liking for them. The laundress
at the Perkins Institution secretly carried her off to give her a bath.
This was too much for poor Nancy. When I next saw her she was a formless
heap of cotton, which I should not have recognized at all except for the
two bead eyes which looked out at me reproachfully.

When the train at last pulled into the station at Boston it was as if a
beautiful fairy tale had come true. The "once upon a time" was now; the
"far-away country" was here.

We had scarcely arrived at the Perkins Institution for the Blind when
I began to make friends with the little blind children. It delighted me
inexpressibly to find that they knew the manual alphabet. What joy to
talk with other children in my own language! Until then I had been like
a foreigner speaking through an interpreter. In the school where Laura
Bridgman was taught I was in my own country. It took me some time to
appreciate the fact that my new friends were blind. I knew I could not
see; but it did not seem possible that all the eager, loving children
who gathered round me and joined heartily in my frolics were also blind.
I remember the surprise and the pain I felt as I noticed that they
placed their hands over mine when I talked to them and that they read
books with their fingers. Although I had been told this before, and
although I understood my own deprivations, yet I had thought vaguely
that since they could hear, they must have a sort of "second sight,"
and I was not prepared to find one child and another and yet another
deprived of the same precious gift. But they were so happy and contented
that I lost all sense of pain in the pleasure of their companionship.

One day spent with the blind children made me feel thoroughly at home in
my new environment, and I looked eagerly from one pleasant experience to
another as the days flew swiftly by. I could not quite convince myself
that there was much world left, for I regarded Boston as the beginning
and the end of creation.

While we were in Boston we visited Bunker Hill, and there I had my first
lesson in history. The story of the brave men who had fought on the spot
where we stood excited me greatly. I climbed the monument, counting the
steps, and wondering as I went higher and yet higher if the soldiers had
climbed this great stairway and shot at the enemy on the ground below.

The next day we went to Plymouth by water. This was my first trip on the
ocean and my first voyage in a steamboat. How full of life and motion
it was! But the rumble of the machinery made me think it was thundering,
and I began to cry, because I feared if it rained we should not be able
to have our picnic out of doors. I was more interested, I think, in
the great rock on which the Pilgrims landed than in anything else in
Plymouth. I could touch it, and perhaps that made the coming of the
Pilgrims and their toils and great deeds seem more real to me. I have
often held in my hand a little model of the Plymouth Rock which a kind
gentleman gave me at Pilgrim Hall, and I have fingered its curves, the
split in the centre and the embossed figures "1620," and turned over in
my mind all that I knew about the wonderful story of the Pilgrims.

How my childish imagination glowed with the splendour of their
enterprise! I idealized them as the bravest and most generous men that
ever sought a home in a strange land. I thought they desired the freedom
of their fellow men as well as their own. I was keenly surprised and
disappointed years later to learn of their acts of persecution that make
us tingle with shame, even while we glory in the courage and energy that
gave us our "Country Beautiful."

Among the many friends I made in Boston were Mr. William Endicott and
his daughter. Their kindness to me was the seed from which many pleasant
memories have since grown. One day we visited their beautiful home
at Beverly Farms. I remember with delight how I went through their
rose-garden, how their dogs, big Leo and little curly-haired Fritz with
long ears, came to meet me, and how Nimrod, the swiftest of the horses,
poked his nose into my hands for a pat and a lump of sugar. I also
remember the beach, where for the first time I played in the sand.
It was hard, smooth sand, very different from the loose, sharp sand,
mingled with kelp and shells, at Brewster. Mr. Endicott told me about
the great ships that came sailing by from Boston, bound for Europe. I
saw him many times after that, and he was always a good friend to me;
indeed, I was thinking of him when I called Boston "the City of Kind
Hearts."



CHAPTER X

Just before the Perkins Institution closed for the summer, it was
arranged that my teacher and I should spend our vacation at Brewster,
on Cape Cod, with our dear friend, Mrs. Hopkins. I was delighted, for my
mind was full of the prospective joys and of the wonderful stories I had
heard about the sea.

My most vivid recollection of that summer is the ocean. I had always
lived far inland and had never had so much as a whiff of salt air; but
I had read in a big book called "Our World" a description of the ocean
which filled me with wonder and an intense longing to touch the
mighty sea and feel it roar. So my little heart leaped high with eager
excitement when I knew that my wish was at last to be realized.

No sooner had I been helped into my bathing-suit than I sprang out upon
the warm sand and without thought of fear plunged into the cool water.
I felt the great billows rock and sink. The buoyant motion of the water
filled me with an exquisite, quivering joy. Suddenly my ecstasy gave
place to terror; for my foot struck against a rock and the next instant
there was a rush of water over my head. I thrust out my hands to grasp
some support, I clutched at the water and at the seaweed which the waves
tossed in my face. But all my frantic efforts were in vain. The waves
seemed to be playing a game with me, and tossed me from one to another
in their wild frolic. It was fearful! The good, firm earth had slipped
from my feet, and everything seemed shut out from this strange,
all-enveloping element--life, air, warmth and love. At last, however,
the sea, as if weary of its new toy, threw me back on the shore, and in
another instant I was clasped in my teacher's arms. Oh, the comfort
of the long, tender embrace! As soon as I had recovered from my panic
sufficiently to say anything, I demanded: "Who put salt in the water?"

After I had recovered from my first experience in the water, I thought
it great fun to sit on a big rock in my bathing-suit and feel wave after
wave dash against the rock, sending up a shower of spray which quite
covered me. I felt the pebbles rattling as the waves threw their
ponderous weight against the shore; the whole beach seemed racked by
their terrific onset, and the air throbbed with their pulsations. The
breakers would swoop back to gather themselves for a mightier leap, and
I clung to the rock, tense, fascinated, as I felt the dash and roar of
the rushing sea!

I could never stay long enough on the shore. The tang of the untainted,
fresh and free sea air was like a cool, quieting thought, and the shells
and pebbles and the seaweed with tiny living creatures attached to it
never lost their fascination for me. One day Miss Sullivan attracted
my attention to a strange object which she had captured basking in the
shallow water. It was a great horseshoe crab--the first one I had ever
seen. I felt of him and thought it very strange that he should carry
his house on his back. It suddenly occurred to me that he might make a
delightful pet; so I seized him by the tail with both hands and carried
him home. This feat pleased me highly, as his body was very heavy, and
it took all my strength to drag him half a mile. I would not leave Miss
Sullivan in peace until she had put the crab in a trough near the well
where I was confident he would be secure. But next morning I went to the
trough, and lo, he had disappeared! Nobody knew where he had gone, or
how he had escaped. My disappointment was bitter at the time; but little
by little I came to realize that it was not kind or wise to force this
poor dumb creature out of his element, and after awhile I felt happy in
the thought that perhaps he had returned to the sea.



CHAPTER XI

In the autumn I returned to my Southern home with a heart full of joyous
memories. As I recall that visit North I am filled with wonder at the
richness and variety of the experiences that cluster about it. It
seems to have been the beginning of everything. The treasures of a
new, beautiful world were laid at my feet, and I took in pleasure and
information at every turn. I lived myself into all things. I was never
still a moment; my life was as full of motion as those little insects
that crowd a whole existence into one brief day. I met many people who
talked with me by spelling into my hand, and thought in joyous sympathy
leaped up to meet thought, and behold, a miracle had been wrought! The
barren places between my mind and the minds of others blossomed like the
rose.

I spent the autumn months with my family at our summer cottage, on a
mountain about fourteen miles from Tuscumbia. It was called Fern Quarry,
because near it there was a limestone quarry, long since abandoned.
Three frolicsome little streams ran through it from springs in the rocks
above, leaping here and tumbling there in laughing cascades wherever the
rocks tried to bar their way. The opening was filled with ferns which
completely covered the beds of limestone and in places hid the streams.
The rest of the mountain was thickly wooded. Here were great oaks and
splendid evergreens with trunks like mossy pillars, from the branches of
which hung garlands of ivy and mistletoe, and persimmon trees, the
odour of which pervaded every nook and corner of the wood--an illusive,
fragrant something that made the heart glad. In places the wild
muscadine and scuppernong vines stretched from tree to tree, making
arbours which were always full of butterflies and buzzing insects. It
was delightful to lose ourselves in the green hollows of that tangled
wood in the late afternoon, and to smell the cool, delicious odours that
came up from the earth at the close of day.

Our cottage was a sort of rough camp, beautifully situated on the top of
the mountain among oaks and pines. The small rooms were arranged on each
side of a long open hall. Round the house was a wide piazza, where the
mountain winds blew, sweet with all wood-scents. We lived on the piazza
most of the time--there we worked, ate and played. At the back door
there was a great butternut tree, round which the steps had been built,
and in front the trees stood so close that I could touch them and feel
the wind shake their branches, or the leaves twirl downward in the
autumn blast.

Many visitors came to Fern Quarry. In the evening, by the campfire, the
men played cards and whiled away the hours in talk and sport. They told
stories of their wonderful feats with fowl, fish and quadruped--how
many wild ducks and turkeys they had shot, what "savage trout" they had
caught, and how they had bagged the craftiest foxes, outwitted the most
clever 'possums and overtaken the fleetest deer, until I thought that
surely the lion, the tiger, the bear and the rest of the wild tribe
would not be able to stand before these wily hunters. "To-morrow to the
chase!" was their good-night shout as the circle of merry friends broke
up for the night. The men slept in the hall outside our door, and I
could feel the deep breathing of the dogs and the hunters as they lay on
their improvised beds.

At dawn I was awakened by the smell of coffee, the rattling of guns,
and the heavy footsteps of the men as they strode about, promising
themselves the greatest luck of the season. I could also feel the
stamping of the horses, which they had ridden out from town and hitched
under the trees, where they stood all night, neighing loudly, impatient
to be off. At last the men mounted, and, as they say in the old songs,
away went the steeds with bridles ringing and whips cracking and hounds
racing ahead, and away went the champion hunters "with hark and whoop
and wild halloo!"

Later in the morning we made preparations for a barbecue. A fire was
kindled at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground, big sticks were laid
crosswise at the top, and meat was hung from them and turned on spits.
Around the fire squatted negroes, driving away the flies with long
branches. The savoury odour of the meat made me hungry long before the
tables were set.

When the bustle and excitement of preparation was at its height, the
hunting party made its appearance, struggling in by twos and threes, the
men hot and weary, the horses covered with foam, and the jaded hounds
panting and dejected--and not a single kill! Every man declared that he
had seen at least one deer, and that the animal had come very close;
but however hotly the dogs might pursue the game, however well the
guns might be aimed, at the snap of the trigger there was not a deer
in sight. They had been as fortunate as the little boy who said he came
very near seeing a rabbit--he saw his tracks. The party soon forgot its
disappointment, however, and we sat down, not to venison, but to a tamer
feast of veal and roast pig.

One summer I had my pony at Fern Quarry. I called him Black Beauty, as I
had just read the book, and he resembled his namesake in every way, from
his glossy black coat to the white star on his forehead. I spent many of
my happiest hours on his back. Occasionally, when it was quite safe,
my teacher would let go the leading-rein, and the pony sauntered on or
stopped at his sweet will to eat grass or nibble the leaves of the trees
that grew beside the narrow trail.

On mornings when I did not care for the ride, my teacher and I would
start after breakfast for a ramble in the woods, and allow ourselves
to get lost amid the trees and vines, with no road to follow except
the paths made by cows and horses. Frequently we came upon impassable
thickets which forced us to take a round about way. We always returned
to the cottage with armfuls of laurel, goldenrod, ferns and gorgeous
swamp-flowers such as grow only in the South.

Sometimes I would go with Mildred and my little cousins to gather
persimmons. I did not eat them; but I loved their fragrance and enjoyed
hunting for them in the leaves and grass. We also went nutting, and I
helped them open the chestnut burrs and break the shells of hickory-nuts
and walnuts--the big, sweet walnuts!

At the foot of the mountain there was a railroad, and the children
watched the trains whiz by. Sometimes a terrific whistle brought us to
the steps, and Mildred told me in great excitement that a cow or a
horse had strayed on the track. About a mile distant there was a trestle
spanning a deep gorge. It was very difficult to walk over, the ties were
wide apart and so narrow that one felt as if one were walking on knives.
I had never crossed it until one day Mildred, Miss Sullivan and I were
lost in the woods, and wandered for hours without finding a path.

Suddenly Mildred pointed with her little hand and exclaimed, "There's
the trestle!" We would have taken any way rather than this; but it was
late and growing dark, and the trestle was a short cut home. I had to
feel for the rails with my toe; but I was not afraid, and got on
very well, until all at once there came a faint "puff, puff" from the
distance.

"I see the train!" cried Mildred, and in another minute it would have
been upon us had we not climbed down on the crossbraces while it rushed
over our heads. I felt the hot breath from the engine on my face, and
the smoke and ashes almost choked us. As the train rumbled by, the
trestle shook and swayed until I thought we should be dashed to the
chasm below. With the utmost difficulty we regained the track. Long
after dark we reached home and found the cottage empty; the family were
all out hunting for us.



CHAPTER XII

After my first visit to Boston, I spent almost every winter in the
North. Once I went on a visit to a New England village with its frozen
lakes and vast snow fields. It was then that I had opportunities such as
had never been mine to enter into the treasures of the snow.

I recall my surprise on discovering that a mysterious hand had stripped
the trees and bushes, leaving only here and there a wrinkled leaf. The
birds had flown, and their empty nests in the bare trees were filled
with snow. Winter was on hill and field. The earth seemed benumbed by
his icy touch, and the very spirits of the trees had withdrawn to their
roots, and there, curled up in the dark, lay fast asleep. All life
seemed to have ebbed away, and even when the sun shone the day was

     Shrunk and cold,
     As if her veins were sapless and old,
     And she rose up
     decrepitly For a last dim look at earth and sea.

The withered grass and the bushes were transformed into a forest of
icicles.

Then came a day when the chill air portended a snowstorm. We rushed
out-of-doors to feel the first few tiny flakes descending. Hour by hour
the flakes dropped silently, softly from their airy height to the earth,
and the country became more and more level. A snowy night closed upon
the world, and in the morning one could scarcely recognize a feature
of the landscape. All the roads were hidden, not a single landmark was
visible, only a waste of snow with trees rising out of it.

In the evening a wind from the northeast sprang up, and the flakes
rushed hither and thither in furious melee. Around the great fire we sat
and told merry tales, and frolicked, and quite forgot that we were in
the midst of a desolate solitude, shut in from all communication with
the outside world. But during the night the fury of the wind increased
to such a degree that it thrilled us with a vague terror. The rafters
creaked and strained, and the branches of the trees surrounding the
house rattled and beat against the windows, as the winds rioted up and
down the country.

On the third day after the beginning of the storm the snow ceased. The
sun broke through the clouds and shone upon a vast, undulating
white plain. High mounds, pyramids heaped in fantastic shapes, and
impenetrable drifts lay scattered in every direction.

Narrow paths were shoveled through the drifts. I put on my cloak and
hood and went out. The air stung my cheeks like fire. Half walking in
the paths, half working our way through the lesser drifts, we succeeded
in reaching a pine grove just outside a broad pasture. The trees stood
motionless and white like figures in a marble frieze. There was no odour
of pine-needles. The rays of the sun fell upon the trees, so that the
twigs sparkled like diamonds and dropped in showers when we touched
them. So dazzling was the light, it penetrated even the darkness that
veils my eyes.

As the days wore on, the drifts gradually shrunk, but before they were
wholly gone another storm came, so that I scarcely felt the earth under
my feet once all winter. At intervals the trees lost their icy covering,
and the bulrushes and underbrush were bare; but the lake lay frozen and
hard beneath the sun.

Our favourite amusement during that winter was tobogganing. In places
the shore of the lake rises abruptly from the water's edge. Down these
steep slopes we used to coast. We would get on our toboggan, a boy
would give us a shove, and off we went! Plunging through drifts, leaping
hollows, swooping down upon the lake, we would shoot across its gleaming
surface to the opposite bank. What joy! What exhilarating madness! For
one wild, glad moment we snapped the chain that binds us to earth, and
joining hands with the winds we felt ourselves divine!



CHAPTER XIII

It was in the spring of 1890 that I learned to speak. The impulse to
utter audible sounds had always been strong within me. I used to make
noises, keeping one hand on my throat while the other hand felt the
movements of my lips. I was pleased with anything that made a noise and
liked to feel the cat purr and the dog bark. I also liked to keep my
hand on a singer's throat, or on a piano when it was being played.
Before I lost my sight and hearing, I was fast learning to talk, but
after my illness it was found that I had ceased to speak because I could
not hear. I used to sit in my mother's lap all day long and keep my
hands on her face because it amused me to feel the motions of her lips;
and I moved my lips, too, although I had forgotten what talking was. My
friends say that I laughed and cried naturally, and for awhile I
made many sounds and word-elements, not because they were a means of
communication, but because the need of exercising my vocal organs was
imperative. There was, however, one word the meaning of which I still
remembered, WATER. I pronounced it "wa-wa." Even this became less and
less intelligible until the time when Miss Sullivan began to teach me.
I stopped using it only after I had learned to spell the word on my
fingers.

I had known for a long time that the people about me used a method of
communication different from mine; and even before I knew that a deaf
child could be taught to speak, I was conscious of dissatisfaction with
the means of communication I already possessed. One who is entirely
dependent upon the manual alphabet has always a sense of restraint,
of narrowness. This feeling began to agitate me with a vexing,
forward-reaching sense of a lack that should be filled. My thoughts
would often rise and beat up like birds against the wind, and I
persisted in using my lips and voice. Friends tried to discourage this
tendency, fearing lest it would lead to disappointment. But I persisted,
and an accident soon occurred which resulted in the breaking down of
this great barrier--I heard the story of Ragnhild Kaata.

In 1890 Mrs. Lamson, who had been one of Laura Bridgman's teachers, and
who had just returned from a visit to Norway and Sweden, came to see me,
and told me of Ragnhild Kaata, a deaf and blind girl in Norway who had
actually been taught to speak. Mrs. Lamson had scarcely finished telling
me about this girl's success before I was on fire with eagerness. I
resolved that I, too, would learn to speak. I would not rest satisfied
until my teacher took me, for advice and assistance, to Miss Sarah
Fuller, principal of the Horace Mann School. This lovely, sweet-natured
lady offered to teach me herself, and we began the twenty-sixth of
March, 1890.

Miss Fuller's method was this: she passed my hand lightly over her face,
and let me feel the position of her tongue and lips when she made a
sound. I was eager to imitate every motion and in an hour had learned
six elements of speech: M, P, A, S, T, I. Miss Fuller gave me eleven
lessons in all. I shall never forget the surprise and delight I felt
when I uttered my first connected sentence, "It is warm." True, they
were broken and stammering syllables; but they were human speech. My
soul, conscious of new strength, came out of bondage, and was reaching
through those broken symbols of speech to all knowledge and all faith.

No deaf child who has earnestly tried to speak the words which he has
never heard--to come out of the prison of silence, where no tone
of love, no song of bird, no strain of music ever pierces the
stillness--can forget the thrill of surprise, the joy of discovery
which came over him when he uttered his first word. Only such a one
can appreciate the eagerness with which I talked to my toys, to stones,
trees, birds and dumb animals, or the delight I felt when at my call
Mildred ran to me or my dogs obeyed my commands. It is an unspeakable
boon to me to be able to speak in winged words that need no
interpretation. As I talked, happy thoughts fluttered up out of my words
that might perhaps have struggled in vain to escape my fingers.

But it must not be supposed that I could really talk in this short time.
I had learned only the elements of speech. Miss Fuller and Miss Sullivan
could understand me, but most people would not have understood one word
in a hundred. Nor is it true that, after I had learned these elements,
I did the rest of the work myself. But for Miss Sullivan's genius,
untiring perseverance and devotion, I could not have progressed as far
as I have toward natural speech. In the first place, I laboured night
and day before I could be understood even by my most intimate friends;
in the second place, I needed Miss Sullivan's assistance constantly in
my efforts to articulate each sound clearly and to combine all sounds
in a thousand ways. Even now she calls my attention every day to
mispronounced words.

All teachers of the deaf know what this means, and only they can at all
appreciate the peculiar difficulties with which I had to contend. In
reading my teacher's lips I was wholly dependent on my fingers: I had
to use the sense of touch in catching the vibrations of the throat, the
movements of the mouth and the expression of the face; and often this
sense was at fault. In such cases I was forced to repeat the words or
sentences, sometimes for hours, until I felt the proper ring in my own
voice. My work was practice, practice, practice. Discouragement and
weariness cast me down frequently; but the next moment the thought that
I should soon be at home and show my loved ones what I had accomplished,
spurred me on, and I eagerly looked forward to their pleasure in my
achievement.

"My little sister will understand me now," was a thought stronger than
all obstacles. I used to repeat ecstatically, "I am not dumb now." I
could not be despondent while I anticipated the delight of talking to my
mother and reading her responses from her lips. It astonished me to
find how much easier it is to talk than to spell with the fingers, and
I discarded the manual alphabet as a medium of communication on my part;
but Miss Sullivan and a few friends still use it in speaking to me, for
it is more convenient and more rapid than lip-reading.

Just here, perhaps, I had better explain our use of the manual alphabet,
which seems to puzzle people who do not know us. One who reads or
talks to me spells with his hand, using the single-hand manual alphabet
generally employed by the deaf. I place my hand on the hand of the
speaker so lightly as not to impede its movements. The position of the
hand is as easy to feel as it is to see. I do not feel each letter
any more than you see each letter separately when you read. Constant
practice makes the fingers very flexible, and some of my friends spell
rapidly--about as fast as an expert writes on a typewriter. The mere
spelling is, of course, no more a conscious act than it is in writing.

When I had made speech my own, I could not wait to go home. At last
the happiest of happy moments arrived. I had made my homeward journey,
talking constantly to Miss Sullivan, not for the sake of talking, but
determined to improve to the last minute. Almost before I knew it, the
train stopped at the Tuscumbia station, and there on the platform stood
the whole family. My eyes fill with tears now as I think how my mother
pressed me close to her, speechless and trembling with delight, taking
in every syllable that I spoke, while little Mildred seized my free
hand and kissed it and danced, and my father expressed his pride and
affection in a big silence. It was as if Isaiah's prophecy had been
fulfilled in me, "The mountains and the hills shall break forth before
you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
hands!"



CHAPTER XIV

The winter of 1892 was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood's
bright sky. Joy deserted my heart, and for a long, long time I lived in
doubt, anxiety and fear. Books lost their charm for me, and even now the
thought of those dreadful days chills my heart. A little story called
"The Frost King," which I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos, of the Perkins
Institution for the Blind, was at the root of the trouble. In order to
make the matter clear, I must set forth the facts connected with this
episode, which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to relate.

I wrote the story when I was at home, the autumn after I had learned to
speak. We had stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual. While we
were there, Miss Sullivan had described to me the beauties of the late
foliage, and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of
a story, which must have been read to me, and which I must have
unconsciously retained. I thought then that I was "making up a story,"
as children say, and I eagerly sat down to write it before the ideas
should slip from me. My thoughts flowed easily; I felt a sense of joy in
the composition. Words and images came tripping to my finger ends, and
as I thought out sentence after sentence, I wrote them on my braille
slate. Now, if words and images come to me without effort, it is a
pretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind, but
stray waifs that I regretfully dismiss. At that time I eagerly absorbed
everything I read without a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot
be quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in
books. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me
through the medium of others' eyes and ears.

When the story was finished, I read it to my teacher, and I recall
now vividly the pleasure I felt in the more beautiful passages, and
my annoyance at being interrupted to have the pronunciation of a word
corrected. At dinner it was read to the assembled family, who were
surprised that I could write so well. Some one asked me if I had read it
in a book.

This question surprised me very much; for I had not the faintest
recollection of having had it read to me. I spoke up and said, "Oh, no,
it is my story, and I have written it for Mr. Anagnos."

Accordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday. It
was suggested that I should change the title from "Autumn Leaves"
to "The Frost King," which I did. I carried the little story to the
post-office myself, feeling as if I were walking on air. I little
dreamed how cruelly I should pay for that birthday gift.

Mr. Anagnos was delighted with "The Frost King," and published it in
one of the Perkins Institution reports. This was the pinnacle of my
happiness, from which I was in a little while dashed to earth. I had
been in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story
similar to "The Frost King," called "The Frost Fairies" by Miss Margaret
T. Canby, had appeared before I was born in a book called "Birdie and
His Friends." The two stories were so much alike in thought and language
that it was evident Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and that
mine was--a plagiarism. It was difficult to make me understand this; but
when I did understand I was astonished and grieved. No child ever drank
deeper of the cup of bitterness than I did. I had disgraced myself;
I had brought suspicion upon those I loved best. And yet how could it
possibly have happened? I racked my brain until I was weary to recall
anything about the frost that I had read before I wrote "The Frost
King"; but I could remember nothing, except the common reference to Jack
Frost, and a poem for children, "The Freaks of the Frost," and I knew I
had not used that in my composition.

At first Mr. Anagnos, though deeply troubled, seemed to believe me. He
was unusually tender and kind to me, and for a brief space the shadow
lifted. To please him I tried not to be unhappy, and to make myself as
pretty as possible for the celebration of Washington's birthday, which
took place very soon after I received the sad news.

I was to be Ceres in a kind of masque given by the blind girls. How well
I remember the graceful draperies that enfolded me, the bright autumn
leaves that wreathed my head, and the fruit and grain at my feet and in
my hands, and beneath all the piety of the masque the oppressive sense
of coming ill that made my heart heavy.

The night before the celebration, one of the teachers of the Institution
had asked me a question connected with "The Frost King," and I was
telling her that Miss Sullivan had talked to me about Jack Frost and
his wonderful works. Something I said made her think she detected in my
words a confession that I did remember Miss Canby's story of "The Frost
Fairies," and she laid her conclusions before Mr. Anagnos, although I
had told her most emphatically that she was mistaken.

Mr. Anagnos, who loved me tenderly, thinking that he had been deceived,
turned a deaf ear to the pleadings of love and innocence. He believed,
or at least suspected, that Miss Sullivan and I had deliberately stolen
the bright thoughts of another and imposed them on him to win his
admiration. I was brought before a court of investigation composed of
the teachers and officers of the Institution, and Miss Sullivan was
asked to leave me. Then I was questioned and cross-questioned with what
seemed to me a determination on the part of my judges to force me to
acknowledge that I remembered having had "The Frost Fairies" read to
me. I felt in every question the doubt and suspicion that was in
their minds, and I felt, too, that a loved friend was looking at me
reproachfully, although I could not have put all this into words. The
blood pressed about my thumping heart, and I could scarcely speak,
except in monosyllables. Even the consciousness that it was only a
dreadful mistake did not lessen my suffering, and when at last I was
allowed to leave the room, I was dazed and did not notice my teacher's
caresses, or the tender words of my friends, who said I was a brave
little girl and they were proud of me.

As I lay in my bed that night, I wept as I hope few children have wept.
I felt so cold, I imagined I should die before morning, and the thought
comforted me. I think if this sorrow had come to me when I was older,
it would have broken my spirit beyond repairing. But the angel of
forgetfulness has gathered up and carried away much of the misery and
all the bitterness of those sad days.

Miss Sullivan had never heard of "The Frost Fairies" or of the book
in which it was published. With the assistance of Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, she investigated the matter carefully, and at last it came out
that Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby's "Birdie and
His Friends" in 1888, the year that we spent the summer with her at
Brewster. Mrs. Hopkins was unable to find her copy; but she has told me
that at that time, while Miss Sullivan was away on a vacation, she tried
to amuse me by reading from various books, and although she could not
remember reading "The Frost Fairies" any more than I, yet she felt
sure that "Birdie and His Friends" was one of them. She explained the
disappearance of the book by the fact that she had a short time
before sold her house and disposed of many juvenile books, such as
old schoolbooks and fairy tales, and that "Birdie and His Friends" was
probably among them.

The stories had little or no meaning for me then; but the mere spelling
of the strange words was sufficient to amuse a little child who could do
almost nothing to amuse herself; and although I do not recall a single
circumstance connected with the reading of the stories, yet I cannot
help thinking that I made a great effort to remember the words, with the
intention of having my teacher explain them when she returned. One thing
is certain, the language was ineffaceably stamped upon my brain, though
for a long time no one knew it, least of all myself.

When Miss Sullivan came back, I did not speak to her about "The Frost
Fairies," probably because she began at once to read "Little Lord
Fauntleroy," which filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else.
But the fact remains that Miss Canby's story was read to me once, and
that long after I had forgotten it, it came back to me so naturally that
I never suspected that it was the child of another mind.

In my trouble I received many messages of love and sympathy. All the
friends I loved best, except one, have remained my own to the present
time.

Miss Canby herself wrote kindly, "Some day you will write a great story
out of your own head, that will be a comfort and help to many." But this
kind prophecy has never been fulfilled. I have never played with words
again for the mere pleasure of the game. Indeed, I have ever since been
tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own. For a long time,
when I wrote a letter, even to my mother, I was seized with a sudden
feeling of terror, and I would spell the sentences over and over, to
make sure that I had not read them in a book. Had it not been for the
persistent encouragement of Miss Sullivan, I think I should have given
up trying to write altogether.

I have read "The Frost Fairies" since, also the letters I wrote in which
I used other ideas of Miss Canby's. I find in one of them, a letter to
Mr. Anagnos, dated September 29, 1891, words and sentiments exactly like
those of the book. At the time I was writing "The Frost King," and this
letter, like many others, contains phrases which show that my mind was
saturated with the story. I represent my teacher as saying to me of the
golden autumn leaves, "Yes, they are beautiful enough to comfort us for
the flight of summer"--an idea direct from Miss Canby's story.

This habit of assimilating what pleased me and giving it out again as my
own appears in much of my early correspondence and my first attempts at
writing. In a composition which I wrote about the old cities of Greece
and Italy, I borrowed my glowing descriptions, with variations, from
sources I have forgotten. I knew Mr. Anagnos's great love of antiquity
and his enthusiastic appreciation of all beautiful sentiments about
Italy and Greece. I therefore gathered from all the books I read every
bit of poetry or of history that I thought would give him pleasure. Mr.
Anagnos, in speaking of my composition on the cities, has said, "These
ideas are poetic in their essence." But I do not understand how he ever
thought a blind and deaf child of eleven could have invented them. Yet
I cannot think that because I did not originate the ideas, my little
composition is therefore quite devoid of interest. It shows me that I
could express my appreciation of beautiful and poetic ideas in clear and
animated language.

Those early compositions were mental gymnastics. I was learning, as all
young and inexperienced persons learn, by assimilation and imitation,
to put ideas into words. Everything I found in books that pleased me I
retained in my memory, consciously or unconsciously, and adapted it.
The young writer, as Stevenson has said, instinctively tries to copy
whatever seems most admirable, and he shifts his admiration with
astonishing versatility. It is only after years of this sort of practice
that even great men have learned to marshal the legion of words which
come thronging through every byway of the mind.

I am afraid I have not yet completed this process. It is certain that
I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read,
because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind.
Consequently, in nearly all that I write, I produce something which very
much resembles the crazy patchwork I used to make when I first learned
to sew. This patchwork was made of all sorts of odds and ends--pretty
bits of silk and velvet; but the coarse pieces that were not pleasant to
touch always predominated. Likewise my compositions are made up of crude
notions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions
of the authors I have read. It seems to me that the great difficulty
of writing is to make the language of the educated mind express our
confused ideas, half feelings, half thoughts, when we are little more
than bundles of instinctive tendencies. Trying to write is very much
like trying to put a Chinese puzzle together. We have a pattern in
mind which we wish to work out in words; but the words will not fit the
spaces, or, if they do, they will not match the design. But we keep
on trying because we know that others have succeeded, and we are not
willing to acknowledge defeat.

"There is no way to become original, except to be born so," says
Stevenson, and although I may not be original, I hope sometime to
outgrow my artificial, periwigged compositions. Then, perhaps, my own
thoughts and experiences will come to the surface. Meanwhile I trust and
hope and persevere, and try not to let the bitter memory of "The Frost
King" trammel my efforts.

So this sad experience may have done me good and set me thinking on some
of the problems of composition. My only regret is that it resulted in
the loss of one of my dearest friends, Mr. Anagnos.

Since the publication of "The Story of My Life" in the Ladies' Home
Journal, Mr. Anagnos has made a statement, in a letter to Mr. Macy, that
at the time of the "Frost King" matter, he believed I was innocent. He
says, the court of investigation before which I was brought consisted
of eight people: four blind, four seeing persons. Four of them, he says,
thought I knew that Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and the
others did not hold this view. Mr. Anagnos states that he cast his vote
with those who were favourable to me.

But, however the case may have been, with whichever side he may have
cast his vote, when I went into the room where Mr. Anagnos had so often
held me on his knee and, forgetting his many cares, had shared in my
frolics, and found there persons who seemed to doubt me, I felt that
there was something hostile and menacing in the very atmosphere, and
subsequent events have borne out this impression. For two years he seems
to have held the belief that Miss Sullivan and I were innocent. Then he
evidently retracted his favourable judgment, why I do not know. Nor did
I know the details of the investigation. I never knew even the names of
the members of the "court" who did not speak to me. I was too excited
to notice anything, too frightened to ask questions. Indeed, I could
scarcely think what I was saying, or what was being said to me.

I have given this account of the "Frost King" affair because it was
important in my life and education; and, in order that there might be no
misunderstanding, I have set forth all the facts as they appear to me,
without a thought of defending myself or of laying blame on any one.



CHAPTER XV

The summer and winter following the "Frost King" incident I spent with
my family in Alabama. I recall with delight that home-going. Everything
had budded and blossomed. I was happy. "The Frost King" was forgotten.

When the ground was strewn with the crimson and golden leaves of autumn,
and the musk-scented grapes that covered the arbour at the end of the
garden were turning golden brown in the sunshine, I began to write a
sketch of my life--a year after I had written "The Frost King."

I was still excessively scrupulous about everything I wrote. The thought
that what I wrote might not be absolutely my own tormented me. No one
knew of these fears except my teacher. A strange sensitiveness prevented
me from referring to the "Frost King"; and often when an idea flashed
out in the course of conversation I would spell softly to her, "I am
not sure it is mine." At other times, in the midst of a paragraph I was
writing, I said to myself, "Suppose it should be found that all this was
written by some one long ago!" An impish fear clutched my hand, so that
I could not write any more that day. And even now I sometimes feel the
same uneasiness and disquietude. Miss Sullivan consoled and helped me in
every way she could think of; but the terrible experience I had passed
through left a lasting impression on my mind, the significance of
which I am only just beginning to understand. It was with the hope of
restoring my self-confidence that she persuaded me to write for the
Youth's Companion a brief account of my life. I was then twelve years
old. As I look back on my struggle to write that little story, it seems
to me that I must have had a prophetic vision of the good that would
come of the undertaking, or I should surely have failed.

I wrote timidly, fearfully, but resolutely, urged on by my teacher, who
knew that if I persevered, I should find my mental foothold again and
get a grip on my faculties. Up to the time of the "Frost King" episode,
I had lived the unconscious life of a little child; now my thoughts were
turned inward, and I beheld things invisible. Gradually I emerged from
the penumbra of that experience with a mind made clearer by trial and
with a truer knowledge of life.

The chief events of the year 1893 were my trip to Washington during
the inauguration of President Cleveland, and visits to Niagara and
the World's Fair. Under such circumstances my studies were constantly
interrupted and often put aside for many weeks, so that it is impossible
for me to give a connected account of them.

We went to Niagara in March, 1893. It is difficult to describe my
emotions when I stood on the point which overhangs the American Falls
and felt the air vibrate and the earth tremble.

It seems strange to many people that I should be impressed by the
wonders and beauties of Niagara. They are always asking: "What does this
beauty or that music mean to you? You cannot see the waves rolling up
the beach or hear their roar. What do they mean to you?" In the most
evident sense they mean everything. I cannot fathom or define their
meaning any more than I can fathom or define love or religion or
goodness.

During the summer of 1893, Miss Sullivan and I visited the World's Fair
with Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. I recall with unmixed delight those days
when a thousand childish fancies became beautiful realities. Every day
in imagination I made a trip round the world, and I saw many wonders
from the uttermost parts of the earth--marvels of invention, treasuries
of industry and skill and all the activities of human life actually
passed under my finger tips.

I liked to visit the Midway Plaisance. It seemed like the "Arabian
Nights," it was crammed so full of novelty and interest. Here was
the India of my books in the curious bazaar with its Shivas and
elephant-gods; there was the land of the Pyramids concentrated in a
model Cairo with its mosques and its long processions of camels; yonder
were the lagoons of Venice, where we sailed every evening when the city
and the fountains were illuminated. I also went on board a Viking
ship which lay a short distance from the little craft. I had been on
a man-of-war before, in Boston, and it interested me to see, on this
Viking ship, how the seaman was once all in all--how he sailed and took
storm and calm alike with undaunted heart, and gave chase to whosoever
reechoed his cry, "We are of the sea!" and fought with brains and
sinews, self-reliant, self-sufficient, instead of being thrust into the
background by unintelligent machinery, as Jack is to-day. So it always
is--"man only is interesting to man."

At a little distance from this ship there was a model of the Santa
Maria, which I also examined. The captain showed me Columbus's cabin and
the desk with an hour-glass on it. This small instrument impressed me
most because it made me think how weary the heroic navigator must have
felt as he saw the sand dropping grain by grain while desperate men were
plotting against his life.

Mr. Higinbotham, President of the World's Fair, kindly gave me
permission to touch the exhibits, and with an eagerness as insatiable
as that with which Pizarro seized the treasures of Peru, I took in
the glories of the Fair with my fingers. It was a sort of tangible
kaleidoscope, this white city of the West. Everything fascinated me,
especially the French bronzes. They were so lifelike, I thought they
were angel visions which the artist had caught and bound in earthly
forms.

At the Cape of Good Hope exhibit, I learned much about the processes of
mining diamonds. Whenever it was possible, I touched the machinery
while it was in motion, so as to get a clearer idea how the stones were
weighed, cut, and polished. I searched in the washings for a diamond and
found it myself--the only true diamond, they said, that was ever found
in the United States.

Dr. Bell went everywhere with us and in his own delightful way described
to me the objects of greatest interest. In the electrical building we
examined the telephones, autophones, phonographs, and other inventions,
and he made me understand how it is possible to send a message on wires
that mock space and outrun time, and, like Prometheus, to draw fire from
the sky. We also visited the anthropological department, and I was much
interested in the relics of ancient Mexico, in the rude stone implements
that are so often the only record of an age--the simple monuments of
nature's unlettered children (so I thought as I fingered them) that seem
bound to last while the memorials of kings and sages crumble in dust
away--and in the Egyptian mummies, which I shrank from touching. From
these relics I learned more about the progress of man than I have heard
or read since.

All these experiences added a great many new terms to my vocabulary,
and in the three weeks I spent at the Fair I took a long leap from the
little child's interest in fairy tales and toys to the appreciation of
the real and the earnest in the workaday world.



CHAPTER XVI

Before October, 1893, I had studied various subjects by myself in a more
or less desultory manner. I read the histories of Greece, Rome and the
United States. I had a French grammar in raised print, and as I already
knew some French, I often amused myself by composing in my head short
exercises, using the new words as I came across them, and ignoring rules
and other technicalities as much as possible. I even tried, without
aid, to master the French pronunciation, as I found all the letters and
sounds described in the book. Of course this was tasking slender powers
for great ends; but it gave me something to do on a rainy day, and
I acquired a sufficient knowledge of French to read with pleasure
La Fontaine's "Fables," "Le Medecin Malgre Lui" and passages from
"Athalie."

I also gave considerable time to the improvement of my speech. I read
aloud to Miss Sullivan and recited passages from my favourite poets,
which I had committed to memory; she corrected my pronunciation and
helped me to phrase and inflect. It was not, however, until October,
1893, after I had recovered from the fatigue and excitement of my visit
to the World's Fair, that I began to have lessons in special subjects at
fixed hours.

Miss Sullivan and I were at that time in Hulton, Pennsylvania, visiting
the family of Mr. William Wade. Mr. Irons, a neighbour of theirs, was
a good Latin scholar; it was arranged that I should study under him. I
remember him as a man of rare, sweet nature and of wide experience.
He taught me Latin grammar principally; but he often helped me in
arithmetic, which I found as troublesome as it was uninteresting. Mr.
Irons also read with me Tennyson's "In Memoriam." I had read many books
before, but never from a critical point of view. I learned for the first
time to know an author, to recognize his style as I recognize the clasp
of a friend's hand.

At first I was rather unwilling to study Latin grammar. It seemed absurd
to waste time analyzing, every word I came across--noun, genitive,
singular, feminine--when its meaning was quite plain. I thought I might
just as well describe my pet in order to know it--order, vertebrate;
division, quadruped; class, mammalia; genus, felinus; species, cat;
individual, Tabby. But as I got deeper into the subject, I became more
interested, and the beauty of the language delighted me. I often amused
myself by reading Latin passages, picking up words I understood and
trying to make sense. I have never ceased to enjoy this pastime.

There is nothing more beautiful, I think, than the evanescent fleeting
images and sentiments presented by a language one is just becoming
familiar with--ideas that flit across the mental sky, shaped and tinted
by capricious fancy. Miss Sullivan sat beside me at my lessons, spelling
into my hand whatever Mr. Irons said, and looking up new words for me. I
was just beginning to read Caesar's "Gallic War" when I went to my home
in Alabama.



CHAPTER XVII

In the summer of 1894, I attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the
American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf.
There it was arranged that I should go to the Wright-Humason School for
the Deaf in New York City. I went there in October, 1894, accompanied
by Miss Sullivan. This school was chosen especially for the purpose
of obtaining the highest advantages in vocal culture and training in
lip-reading. In addition to my work in these subjects, I studied, during
the two years I was in the school, arithmetic, physical geography,
French and German.

Miss Reamy, my German teacher, could use the manual alphabet, and after
I had acquired a small vocabulary, we talked together in German
whenever we had a chance, and in a few months I could understand almost
everything she said. Before the end of the first year I read "Wilhelm
Tell" with the greatest delight. Indeed, I think I made more progress
in German than in any of my other studies. I found French much more
difficult. I studied it with Madame Olivier, a French lady who did not
know the manual alphabet, and who was obliged to give her instruction
orally. I could not read her lips easily; so my progress was much slower
than in German. I managed, however, to read "Le Medecin Malgre Lui"
again. It was very amusing but I did not like it nearly so well as
"Wilhelm Tell."

My progress in lip-reading and speech was not what my teachers and I had
hoped and expected it would be. It was my ambition to speak like other
people, and my teachers believed that this could be accomplished; but,
although we worked hard and faithfully, yet we did not quite reach our
goal. I suppose we aimed too high, and disappointment was therefore
inevitable. I still regarded arithmetic as a system of pitfalls. I hung
about the dangerous frontier of "guess," avoiding with infinite
trouble to myself and others the broad valley of reason. When I was not
guessing, I was jumping at conclusions, and this fault, in addition
to my dullness, aggravated my difficulties more than was right or
necessary.

But although these disappointments caused me great depression at times,
I pursued my other studies with unflagging interest, especially physical
geography. It was a joy to learn the secrets of nature: how--in the
picturesque language of the Old Testament--the winds are made to blow
from the four corners of the heavens, how the vapours ascend from the
ends of the earth, how rivers are cut out among the rocks, and mountains
overturned by the roots, and in what ways man may overcome many forces
mightier than himself. The two years in New York were happy ones, and I
look back to them with genuine pleasure.

I remember especially the walks we all took together every day in
Central Park, the only part of the city that was congenial to me. I
never lost a jot of my delight in this great park. I loved to have
it described every time I entered it; for it was beautiful in all its
aspects, and these aspects were so many that it was beautiful in a
different way each day of the nine months I spent in New York.

In the spring we made excursions to various places of interest. We
sailed on the Hudson River and wandered about on its green banks, of
which Bryant loved to sing. I liked the simple, wild grandeur of the
palisades. Among the places I visited were West Point, Tarrytown, the
home of Washington Irving, where I walked through "Sleepy Hollow."

The teachers at the Wright-Humason School were always planning how they
might give the pupils every advantage that those who hear enjoy--how
they might make much of few tendencies and passive memories in the cases
of the little ones--and lead them out of the cramping circumstances in
which their lives were set.

Before I left New York, these bright days were darkened by the greatest
sorrow that I have ever borne, except the death of my father. Mr. John
P. Spaulding, of Boston, died in February, 1896. Only those who knew and
loved him best can understand what his friendship meant to me. He, who
made every one happy in a beautiful, unobtrusive way, was most kind and
tender to Miss Sullivan and me. So long as we felt his loving presence
and knew that he took a watchful interest in our work, fraught with so
many difficulties, we could not be discouraged. His going away left a
vacancy in our lives that has never been filled.



CHAPTER XVIII

In October, 1896, I entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies, to be
prepared for Radcliffe.

When I was a little girl, I visited Wellesley and surprised my friends
by the announcement, "Some day I shall go to college--but I shall go
to Harvard!" When asked why I would not go to Wellesley, I replied that
there were only girls there. The thought of going to college took root
in my heart and became an earnest desire, which impelled me to enter
into competition for a degree with seeing and hearing girls, in the face
of the strong opposition of many true and wise friends. When I left
New York the idea had become a fixed purpose; and it was decided that
I should go to Cambridge. This was the nearest approach I could get to
Harvard and to the fulfillment of my childish declaration.

At the Cambridge School the plan was to have Miss Sullivan attend the
classes with me and interpret to me the instruction given.

Of course my instructors had had no experience in teaching any but
normal pupils, and my only means of conversing with them was reading
their lips. My studies for the first year were English history, English
literature, German, Latin, arithmetic, Latin composition and occasional
themes. Until then I had never taken a course of study with the idea of
preparing for college; but I had been well drilled in English by Miss
Sullivan, and it soon became evident to my teachers that I needed no
special instruction in this subject beyond a critical study of the books
prescribed by the college. I had had, moreover, a good start in French,
and received six months' instruction in Latin; but German was the
subject with which I was most familiar.

In spite, however, of these advantages, there were serious drawbacks to
my progress. Miss Sullivan could not spell out in my hand all that the
books required, and it was very difficult to have textbooks embossed in
time to be of use to me, although my friends in London and Philadelphia
were willing to hasten the work. For a while, indeed, I had to copy
my Latin in braille, so that I could recite with the other girls. My
instructors soon became sufficiently familiar with my imperfect speech
to answer my questions readily and correct mistakes. I could not make
notes in class or write exercises; but I wrote all my compositions and
translations at home on my typewriter.

Each day Miss Sullivan went to the classes with me and spelled into my
hand with infinite patience all that the teachers said. In study hours
she had to look up new words for me and read and reread notes and books
I did not have in raised print. The tedium of that work is hard to
conceive. Frau Grote, my German teacher, and Mr. Gilman, the principal,
were the only teachers in the school who learned the finger alphabet to
give me instruction. No one realized more fully than dear Frau Grote how
slow and inadequate her spelling was. Nevertheless, in the goodness of
her heart she laboriously spelled out her instructions to me in special
lessons twice a week, to give Miss Sullivan a little rest. But, though
everybody was kind and ready to help us, there was only one hand that
could turn drudgery into pleasure.

That year I finished arithmetic, reviewed my Latin grammar, and read
three chapters of Caesar's "Gallic War." In German I read, partly with
my fingers and partly with Miss Sullivan's assistance, Schiller's "Lied
von der Glocke" and "Taucher," Heine's "Harzreise," Freytag's "Aus dem
Staat Friedrichs des Grossen," Riehl's "Fluch Der Schonheit," Lessing's
"Minna von Barnhelm," and Goethe's "Aus meinem Leben." I took the
greatest delight in these German books, especially Schiller's wonderful
lyrics, the history of Frederick the Great's magnificent achievements
and the account of Goethe's life. I was sorry to finish "Die Harzreise,"
so full of happy witticisms and charming descriptions of vine-clad
hills, streams that sing and ripple in the sunshine, and wild regions,
sacred to tradition and legend, the gray sisters of a long-vanished,
imaginative age--descriptions such as can be given only by those to whom
nature is "a feeling, a love and an appetite."

Mr. Gilman instructed me part of the year in English literature. We
read together, "As You Like It," Burke's "Speech on Conciliation with
America," and Macaulay's "Life of Samuel Johnson." Mr. Gilman's broad
views of history and literature and his clever explanations made my
work easier and pleasanter than it could have been had I only read
notes mechanically with the necessarily brief explanations given in the
classes.

Burke's speech was more instructive than any other book on a political
subject that I had ever read. My mind stirred with the stirring times,
and the characters round which the life of two contending nations
centred seemed to move right before me. I wondered more and more, while
Burke's masterly speech rolled on in mighty surges of eloquence, how it
was that King George and his ministers could have turned a deaf ear
to his warning prophecy of our victory and their humiliation. Then I
entered into the melancholy details of the relation in which the great
statesman stood to his party and to the representatives of the people. I
thought how strange it was that such precious seeds of truth and wisdom
should have fallen among the tares of ignorance and corruption.

In a different way Macaulay's "Life of Samuel Johnson" was interesting.
My heart went out to the lonely man who ate the bread of affliction in
Grub Street, and yet, in the midst of toil and cruel suffering of body
and soul, always had a kind word, and lent a helping hand to the poor
and despised. I rejoiced over all his successes, I shut my eyes to
his faults, and wondered, not that he had them, but that they had not
crushed or dwarfed his soul. But in spite of Macaulay's brilliancy
and his admirable faculty of making the commonplace seem fresh and
picturesque, his positiveness wearied me at times, and his frequent
sacrifices of truth to effect kept me in a questioning attitude
very unlike the attitude of reverence in which I had listened to the
Demosthenes of Great Britain.

At the Cambridge school, for the first time in my life, I enjoyed the
companionship of seeing and hearing girls of my own age. I lived with
several others in one of the pleasant houses connected with the school,
the house where Mr. Howells used to live, and we all had the advantage
of home life. I joined them in many of their games, even blind man's
buff and frolics in the snow; I took long walks with them; we discussed
our studies and read aloud the things that interested us. Some of the
girls learned to speak to me, so that Miss Sullivan did not have to
repeat their conversation.

At Christmas, my mother and little sister spent the holidays with me,
and Mr. Gilman kindly offered to let Mildred study in his school. So
Mildred stayed with me in Cambridge, and for six happy months we were
hardly ever apart. It makes me most happy to remember the hours we spent
helping each other in study and sharing our recreation together.

I took my preliminary examinations for Radcliffe from the 29th of June
to the 3rd of July in 1897. The subjects I offered were Elementary and
Advanced German, French, Latin, English, and Greek and Roman history,
making nine hours in all. I passed in everything, and received "honours"
in German and English.

Perhaps an explanation of the method that was in use when I took my
examinations will not be amiss here. The student was required to pass in
sixteen hours--twelve hours being called elementary and four advanced.
He had to pass five hours at a time to have them counted. The
examination papers were given out at nine o'clock at Harvard and brought
to Radcliffe by a special messenger. Each candidate was known, not
by his name, but by a number. I was No. 233, but, as I had to use a
typewriter, my identity could not be concealed.

It was thought advisable for me to have my examinations in a room by
myself, because the noise of the typewriter might disturb the other
girls. Mr. Gilman read all the papers to me by means of the manual
alphabet. A man was placed on guard at the door to prevent interruption.

The first day I had German. Mr. Gilman sat beside me and read the paper
through first, then sentence by sentence, while I repeated the words
aloud, to make sure that I understood him perfectly. The papers were
difficult, and I felt very anxious as I wrote out my answers on the
typewriter. Mr. Gilman spelled to me what I had written, and I made such
changes as I thought necessary, and he inserted them. I wish to say here
that I have not had this advantage since in any of my examinations. At
Radcliffe no one reads the papers to me after they are written, and I
have no opportunity to correct errors unless I finish before the time is
up. In that case I correct only such mistakes as I can recall in the few
minutes allowed, and make notes of these corrections at the end of my
paper. If I passed with higher credit in the preliminaries than in the
finals, there are two reasons. In the finals, no one read my work over
to me, and in the preliminaries I offered subjects with some of which I
was in a measure familiar before my work in the Cambridge school; for at
the beginning of the year I had passed examinations in English, History,
French and German, which Mr. Gilman gave me from previous Harvard
papers.

Mr. Gilman sent my written work to the examiners with a certificate that
I, candidate No. 233, had written the papers.

All the other preliminary examinations were conducted in the same
manner. None of them was so difficult as the first. I remember that the
day the Latin paper was brought to us, Professor Schilling came in and
informed me I had passed satisfactorily in German. This encouraged me
greatly, and I sped on to the end of the ordeal with a light heart and a
steady hand.



CHAPTER XIX

When I began my second year at the Gilman school, I was full of hope
and determination to succeed. But during the first few weeks I was
confronted with unforeseen difficulties. Mr. Gilman had agreed that that
year I should study mathematics principally. I had physics, algebra,
geometry, astronomy, Greek and Latin. Unfortunately, many of the books
I needed had not been embossed in time for me to begin with the classes,
and I lacked important apparatus for some of my studies. The classes I
was in were very large, and it was impossible for the teachers to give
me special instruction. Miss Sullivan was obliged to read all the books
to me, and interpret for the instructors, and for the first time in
eleven years it seemed as if her dear hand would not be equal to the
task.

It was necessary for me to write algebra and geometry in class and solve
problems in physics, and this I could not do until we bought a braille
writer, by means of which I could put down the steps and processes of my
work. I could not follow with my eyes the geometrical figures drawn on
the blackboard, and my only means of getting a clear idea of them was
to make them on a cushion with straight and curved wires, which had bent
and pointed ends. I had to carry in my mind, as Mr. Keith says in his
report, the lettering of the figures, the hypothesis and conclusion, the
construction and the process of the proof. In a word, every study had
its obstacles. Sometimes I lost all courage and betrayed my feelings in
a way I am ashamed to remember, especially as the signs of my trouble
were afterward used against Miss Sullivan, the only person of all the
kind friends I had there, who could make the crooked straight and the
rough places smooth.

Little by little, however, my difficulties began to disappear. The
embossed books and other apparatus arrived, and I threw myself into the
work with renewed confidence. Algebra and geometry were the only studies
that continued to defy my efforts to comprehend them. As I have said
before, I had no aptitude for mathematics; the different points were
not explained to me as fully as I wished. The geometrical diagrams
were particularly vexing because I could not see the relation of the
different parts to one another, even on the cushion. It was not until
Mr. Keith taught me that I had a clear idea of mathematics.

I was beginning to overcome these difficulties when an event occurred
which changed everything.

Just before the books came, Mr. Gilman had begun to remonstrate with
Miss Sullivan on the ground that I was working too hard, and in spite
of my earnest protestations, he reduced the number of my recitations. At
the beginning we had agreed that I should, if necessary, take five years
to prepare for college, but at the end of the first year the success of
my examinations showed Miss Sullivan, Miss Harbaugh (Mr. Gilman's head
teacher), and one other, that I could without too much effort complete
my preparation in two years more. Mr. Gilman at first agreed to this;
but when my tasks had become somewhat perplexing, he insisted that I was
overworked, and that I should remain at his school three years longer. I
did not like his plan, for I wished to enter college with my class.

On the seventeenth of November I was not very well, and did not go
to school. Although Miss Sullivan knew that my indisposition was not
serious, yet Mr. Gilman, on hearing of it, declared that I was breaking
down and made changes in my studies which would have rendered it
impossible for me to take my final examinations with my class. In the
end the difference of opinion between Mr. Gilman and Miss Sullivan
resulted in my mother's withdrawing my sister Mildred and me from the
Cambridge school.

After some delay it was arranged that I should continue my studies under
a tutor, Mr. Merton S. Keith, of Cambridge. Miss Sullivan and I spent
the rest of the winter with our friends, the Chamberlins in Wrentham,
twenty-five miles from Boston.

From February to July, 1898, Mr. Keith came out to Wrentham twice a
week, and taught me algebra, geometry, Greek and Latin. Miss Sullivan
interpreted his instruction.

In October, 1898, we returned to Boston. For eight months Mr. Keith gave
me lessons five times a week, in periods of about an hour. He explained
each time what I did not understand in the previous lesson, assigned
new work, and took home with him the Greek exercises which I had written
during the week on my typewriter, corrected them fully, and returned
them to me.

In this way my preparation for college went on without interruption.
I found it much easier and pleasanter to be taught by myself than to
receive instruction in class. There was no hurry, no confusion. My tutor
had plenty of time to explain what I did not understand, so I got on
faster and did better work than I ever did in school. I still found more
difficulty in mastering problems in mathematics than I did in any other
of my studies. I wish algebra and geometry had been half as easy as
the languages and literature. But even mathematics Mr. Keith made
interesting; he succeeded in whittling problems small enough to get
through my brain. He kept my mind alert and eager, and trained it to
reason clearly, and to seek conclusions calmly and logically, instead of
jumping wildly into space and arriving nowhere. He was always gentle and
forbearing, no matter how dull I might be, and believe me, my stupidity
would often have exhausted the patience of Job.

On the 29th and 30th of June, 1899, I took my final examinations for
Radcliffe College. The first day I had Elementary Greek and Advanced
Latin, and the second day Geometry, Algebra and Advanced Greek.

The college authorities did not allow Miss Sullivan to read the
examination papers to me; so Mr. Eugene C. Vining, one of the
instructors at the Perkins Institution for the Blind, was employed to
copy the papers for me in American braille. Mr. Vining was a stranger
to me, and could not communicate with me, except by writing braille. The
proctor was also a stranger, and did not attempt to communicate with me
in any way.

The braille worked well enough in the languages, but when it came to
geometry and algebra, difficulties arose. I was sorely perplexed, and
felt discouraged wasting much precious time, especially in algebra. It
is true that I was familiar with all literary braille in common use in
this country--English, American, and New York Point; but the various
signs and symbols in geometry and algebra in the three systems are very
different, and I had used only the English braille in my algebra.

Two days before the examinations, Mr. Vining sent me a braille copy of
one of the old Harvard papers in algebra. To my dismay I found that it
was in the American notation. I sat down immediately and wrote to Mr.
Vining, asking him to explain the signs. I received another paper and a
table of signs by return mail, and I set to work to learn the notation.
But on the night before the algebra examination, while I was struggling
over some very complicated examples, I could not tell the combinations
of bracket, brace and radical. Both Mr. Keith and I were distressed and
full of forebodings for the morrow; but we went over to the college a
little before the examination began, and had Mr. Vining explain more
fully the American symbols.

In geometry my chief difficulty was that I had always been accustomed
to read the propositions in line print, or to have them spelled into
my hand; and somehow, although the propositions were right before me, I
found the braille confusing, and could not fix clearly in my mind what
I was reading. But when I took up algebra I had a harder time still.
The signs, which I had so lately learned, and which I thought I knew,
perplexed me. Besides, I could not see what I wrote on my typewriter. I
had always done my work in braille or in my head. Mr. Keith had relied
too much on my ability to solve problems mentally, and had not trained
me to write examination papers. Consequently my work was painfully slow,
and I had to read the examples over and over before I could form any
idea of what I was required to do. Indeed, I am not sure now that I read
all the signs correctly. I found it very hard to keep my wits about me.

But I do not blame any one. The administrative board of Radcliffe did
not realize how difficult they were making my examinations, nor did
they understand the peculiar difficulties I had to surmount. But if they
unintentionally placed obstacles in my way, I have the consolation of
knowing that I overcame them all.



CHAPTER XX

The struggle for admission to college was ended, and I could now enter
Radcliffe whenever I pleased. Before I entered college, however, it was
thought best that I should study another year under Mr. Keith. It was
not, therefore, until the fall of 1900 that my dream of going to college
was realized.

I remember my first day at Radcliffe. It was a day full of interest
for me. I had looked forward to it for years. A potent force within
me, stronger than the persuasion of my friends, stronger even than
the pleadings of my heart, had impelled me to try my strength by the
standards of those who see and hear. I knew that there were obstacles
in the way; but I was eager to overcome them. I had taken to heart the
words of the wise Roman who said, "To be banished from Rome is but to
live outside of Rome." Debarred from the great highways of knowledge,
I was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented
roads--that was all; and I knew that in college there were many bypaths
where I could touch hands with girls who were thinking, loving and
struggling like me.

I began my studies with eagerness. Before me I saw a new world opening
in beauty and light, and I felt within me the capacity to know all
things. In the wonderland of Mind I should be as free as another. Its
people, scenery, manners, joys, tragedies should be living, tangible
interpreters of the real world. The lecture-halls seemed filled with the
spirit of the great and the wise, and I thought the professors were
the embodiment of wisdom. If I have since learned differently, I am not
going to tell anybody.

But I soon discovered that college was not quite the romantic lyceum
I had imagined. Many of the dreams that had delighted my young
inexperience became beautifully less and "faded into the light of common
day." Gradually I began to find that there were disadvantages in going
to college.

The one I felt and still feel most is lack of time. I used to have time
to think, to reflect, my mind and I. We would sit together of an evening
and listen to the inner melodies of the spirit, which one hears only in
leisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep, sweet
chord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there
is no time to commune with one's thoughts. One goes to college to learn,
it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one
leaves the dearest pleasures--solitude, books and imagination--outside
with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in
the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I
am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a
rainy day.

My studies the first year were French, German, history, English
composition and English literature. In the French course I read some
of the works of Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Alfred de Musset and
Sainte-Beuve, and in the German those of Goethe and Schiller. I reviewed
rapidly the whole period of history from the fall of the Roman Empire
to the eighteenth century, and in English literature studied critically
Milton's poems and "Areopagitica."

I am frequently asked how I overcome the peculiar conditions under which
I work in college. In the classroom I am of course practically alone.
The professor is as remote as if he were speaking through a telephone.
The lectures are spelled into my hand as rapidly as possible, and much
of the individuality of the lecturer is lost to me in the effort to keep
in the race. The words rush through my hand like hounds in pursuit of a
hare which they often miss. But in this respect I do not think I am much
worse off than the girls who take notes. If the mind is occupied
with the mechanical process of hearing and putting words on paper at
pell-mell speed, I should not think one could pay much attention to the
subject under consideration or the manner in which it is presented.
I cannot make notes during the lectures, because my hands are busy
listening. Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get
home. I write the exercises, daily themes, criticisms and hour-tests,
the mid-year and final examinations, on my typewriter, so that the
professors have no difficulty in finding out how little I know. When
I began the study of Latin prosody, I devised and explained to my
professor a system of signs indicating the different meters and
quantities.

I use the Hammond typewriter. I have tried many machines, and I find the
Hammond is the best adapted to the peculiar needs of my work. With this
machine movable type shuttles can be used, and one can have several
shuttles, each with a different set of characters--Greek, French, or
mathematical, according to the kind of writing one wishes to do on the
typewriter. Without it, I doubt if I could go to college.

Very few of the books required in the various courses are printed
for the blind, and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand.
Consequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls.
The manual part takes longer, and I have perplexities which they have
not. There are days when the close attention I must give to details
chafes my spirit, and the thought that I must spend hours reading a
few chapters, while in the world without other girls are laughing and
singing and dancing, makes me rebellious; but I soon recover my buoyancy
and laugh the discontent out of my heart. For, after all, every one who
wishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone, and
since there is no royal road to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own
way. I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the
edge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep
it better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more
eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every
struggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud,
the blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire. I am not always
alone, however, in these struggles. Mr. William Wade and Mr. E. E.
Allen, Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of
the Blind, get for me many of the books I need in raised print. Their
thoughtfulness has been more of a help and encouragement to me than they
can ever know.

Last year, my second year at Radcliffe, I studied English composition,
the Bible as English composition, the governments of America and Europe,
the Odes of Horace, and Latin comedy. The class in composition was the
pleasantest. It was very lively. The lectures were always interesting,
vivacious, witty; for the instructor, Mr. Charles Townsend Copeland,
more than any one else I have had until this year, brings before you
literature in all its original freshness and power. For one short hour
you are permitted to drink in the eternal beauty of the old masters
without needless interpretation or exposition. You revel in their fine
thoughts. You enjoy with all your soul the sweet thunder of the Old
Testament, forgetting the existence of Jahweh and Elohim; and you go
home feeling that you have had "a glimpse of that perfection in which
spirit and form dwell in immortal harmony; truth and beauty bearing a
new growth on the ancient stem of time."

This year is the happiest because I am studying subjects that especially
interest me, economics, Elizabethan literature, Shakespeare under
Professor George L. Kittredge, and the History of Philosophy under
Professor Josiah Royce. Through philosophy one enters with sympathy
of comprehension into the traditions of remote ages and other modes of
thought, which erewhile seemed alien and without reason.

But college is not the universal Athens I thought it was. There one does
not meet the great and the wise face to face; one does not even feel
their living touch. They are there, it is true; but they seem mummified.
We must extract them from the crannied wall of learning and dissect and
analyze them before we can be sure that we have a Milton or an Isaiah,
and not merely a clever imitation. Many scholars forget, it seems to me,
that our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon
the depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding. The trouble is
that very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory. The
mind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit. It is possible to
know a flower, root and stem and all, and all the processes of growth,
and yet to have no appreciation of the flower fresh bathed in heaven's
dew. Again and again I ask impatiently, "Why concern myself with these
explanations and hypotheses?" They fly hither and thither in my thought
like blind birds beating the air with ineffectual wings. I do not mean
to object to a thorough knowledge of the famous works we read. I object
only to the interminable comments and bewildering criticisms that teach
but one thing: there are as many opinions as there are men. But when a
great scholar like Professor Kittredge interprets what the master
said, it is "as if new sight were given the blind." He brings back
Shakespeare, the poet.

There are, however, times when I long to sweep away half the things I am
expected to learn; for the overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it
has secured at the greatest cost. It is impossible, I think, to read in
one day four or five different books in different languages and treating
of widely different subjects, and not lose sight of the very ends for
which one reads. When one reads hurriedly and nervously, having in mind
written tests and examinations, one's brain becomes encumbered with a
lot of choice bric-a-brac for which there seems to be little use. At the
present time my mind is so full of heterogeneous matter that I almost
despair of ever being able to put it in order. Whenever I enter the
region that was the kingdom of my mind I feel like the proverbial bull
in the china shop. A thousand odds and ends of knowledge come
crashing about my head like hailstones, and when I try to escape
them, theme-goblins and college nixies of all sorts pursue me, until
I wish--oh, may I be forgiven the wicked wish!--that I might smash the
idols I came to worship.

But the examinations are the chief bugbears of my college life. Although
I have faced them many times and cast them down and made them bite the
dust, yet they rise again and menace me with pale looks, until like Bob
Acres I feel my courage oozing out at my finger ends. The days before
these ordeals take place are spent in cramming your mind with mystic
formula and indigestible dates--unpalatable diets, until you wish that
books and science and you were buried in the depths of the sea.

At last the dreaded hour arrives, and you are a favoured being indeed
if you feel prepared, and are able at the right time to call to your
standard thoughts that will aid you in that supreme effort. It happens
too often that your trumpet call is unheeded. It is most perplexing and
exasperating that just at the moment when you need your memory and a
nice sense of discrimination, these faculties take to themselves wings
and fly away. The facts you have garnered with such infinite trouble
invariably fail you at a pinch.

"Give a brief account of Huss and his work." Huss? Who was he and what
did he do? The name looks strangely familiar. You ransack your budget
of historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag.
You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top--you saw it
there the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the
Reformation. But where is it now? You fish out all manner of odds
and ends of knowledge--revolutions, schisms, massacres, systems of
government; but Huss--where is he? You are amazed at all the things you
know which are not on the examination paper. In desperation you seize
the budget and dump everything out, and there in a corner is your
man, serenely brooding on his own private thought, unconscious of the
catastrophe which he has brought upon you.

Just then the proctor informs you that the time is up. With a feeling of
intense disgust you kick the mass of rubbish into a corner and go home,
your head full of revolutionary schemes to abolish the divine right of
professors to ask questions without the consent of the questioned.

It comes over me that in the last two or three pages of this chapter I
have used figures which will turn the laugh against me. Ah, here they
are--the mixed metaphors mocking and strutting about before me, pointing
to the bull in the china shop assailed by hailstones and the bugbears
with pale looks, an unanalyzed species! Let them mock on. The words
describe so exactly the atmosphere of jostling, tumbling ideas I live
in that I will wink at them for once, and put on a deliberate air to say
that my ideas of college have changed.

While my days at Radcliffe were still in the future, they were encircled
with a halo of romance, which they have lost; but in the transition from
romantic to actual I have learned many things I should never have known
had I not tried the experiment. One of them is the precious science of
patience, which teaches us that we should take our education as we would
take a walk in the country, leisurely, our minds hospitably open to
impressions of every sort. Such knowledge floods the soul unseen with a
soundless tidal wave of deepening thought. "Knowledge is power."
Rather, knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge--broad, deep
knowledge--is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low.
To know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man's progress is to
feel the great heart-throbs of humanity through the centuries; and if
one does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving, one must
indeed be deaf to the harmonies of life.



CHAPTER XXI

I have thus far sketched the events of my life, but I have not shown how
much I have depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom
they bring to all who read, but also for that knowledge which comes to
others through their eyes and their ears. Indeed, books have meant so
much more in my education than in that of others, that I shall go back
to the time when I began to read.

I read my first connected story in May, 1887, when I was seven years
old, and from that day to this I have devoured everything in the shape
of a printed page that has come within the reach of my hungry finger
tips. As I have said, I did not study regularly during the early years
of my education; nor did I read according to rule.

At first I had only a few books in raised print--"readers" for
beginners, a collection of stories for children, and a book about the
earth called "Our World." I think that was all; but I read them over
and over, until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely
make them out. Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me, spelling into my
hand little stories and poems that she knew I should understand; but I
preferred reading myself to being read to, because I liked to read again
and again the things that pleased me.

It was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read
in good earnest. I was permitted to spend a part of each day in the
Institution library, and to wander from bookcase to bookcase, and take
down whatever book my fingers lighted upon. And read I did, whether I
understood one word in ten or two words on a page. The words themselves
fascinated me; but I took no conscious account of what I read. My mind
must, however, have been very impressionable at that period, for it
retained many words and whole sentences, to the meaning of which I had
not the faintest clue; and afterward, when I began to talk and write,
these words and sentences would flash out quite naturally, so that my
friends wondered at the richness of my vocabulary. I must have read
parts of many books (in those early days I think I never read any one
book through) and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way,
until I discovered "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which was the first book of
any consequence I read understandingly.

One day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over
the pages of "The Scarlet Letter." I was then about eight years old. I
remember she asked me if I liked little Pearl, and explained some of
the words that had puzzled me. Then she told me that she had a beautiful
story about a little boy which she was sure I should like better
than "The Scarlet Letter." The name of the story was "Little Lord
Fauntleroy," and she promised to read it to me the following summer. But
we did not begin the story until August; the first few weeks of my stay
at the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot
the very existence of books. Then my teacher went to visit some friends
in Boston, leaving me for a short time.

When she returned almost the first thing we did was to begin the story
of "Little Lord Fauntleroy." I recall distinctly the time and place when
we read the first chapters of the fascinating child's story. It was a
warm afternoon in August. We were sitting together in a hammock which
swung from two solemn pines at a short distance from the house. We had
hurried through the dish-washing after luncheon, in order that we might
have as long an afternoon as possible for the story. As we hastened
through the long grass toward the hammock, the grasshoppers swarmed
about us and fastened themselves on our clothes, and I remember that
my teacher insisted upon picking them all off before we sat down, which
seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time. The hammock was covered with
pine needles, for it had not been used while my teacher was away. The
warm sun shone on the pine trees and drew out all their fragrance. The
air was balmy, with a tang of the sea in it. Before we began the story
Miss Sullivan explained to me the things that she knew I should not
understand, and as we read on she explained the unfamiliar words.
At first there were many words I did not know, and the reading was
constantly interrupted; but as soon as I thoroughly comprehended the
situation, I became too eagerly absorbed in the story to notice mere
words, and I am afraid I listened impatiently to the explanations that
Miss Sullivan felt to be necessary. When her fingers were too tired
to spell another word, I had for the first time a keen sense of my
deprivations. I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters
with an intensity of longing that I can never forget.

Afterward, at my eager request, Mr. Anagnos had this story embossed,
and I read it again and again, until I almost knew it by heart; and all
through my childhood "Little Lord Fauntleroy" was my sweet and gentle
companion. I have given these details at the risk of being tedious,
because they are in such vivid contrast with my vague, mutable and
confused memories of earlier reading.

From "Little Lord Fauntleroy" I date the beginning of my true interest
in books. During the next two years I read many books at my home and on
my visits to Boston. I cannot remember what they all were, or in what
order I read them; but I know that among them were "Greek Heroes," La
Fontaine's "Fables," Hawthorne's "Wonder Book," "Bible Stories," Lamb's
"Tales from Shakespeare," "A Child's History of England" by Dickens,
"The Arabian Nights," "The Swiss Family Robinson," "The Pilgrim's
Progress," "Robinson Crusoe," "Little Women," and "Heidi," a beautiful
little story which I afterward read in German. I read them in the
intervals between study and play with an ever-deepening sense of
pleasure. I did not study nor analyze them--I did not know whether they
were well written or not; I never thought about style or authorship.
They laid their treasures at my feet, and I accepted them as we accept
the sunshine and the love of our friends. I loved "Little Women" because
it gave me a sense of kinship with girls and boys who could see and
hear. Circumscribed as my life was in so many ways, I had to look
between the covers of books for news of the world that lay outside my
own.

I did not care especially for "The Pilgrim's Progress," which I think I
did not finish, or for the "Fables." I read La Fontaine's "Fables" first
in an English translation, and enjoyed them only after a half-hearted
fashion. Later I read the book again in French, and I found that, in
spite of the vivid word-pictures, and the wonderful mastery of language,
I liked it no better. I do not know why it is, but stories in which
animals are made to talk and act like human beings have never appealed
to me very strongly. The ludicrous caricatures of the animals occupy my
mind to the exclusion of the moral.

Then, again, La Fontaine seldom, if ever, appeals to our highest moral
sense. The highest chords he strikes are those of reason and self-love.
Through all the fables runs the thought that man's morality springs
wholly from self-love, and that if that self-love is directed and
restrained by reason, happiness must follow. Now, so far as I can judge,
self-love is the root of all evil; but, of course, I may be wrong, for
La Fontaine had greater opportunities of observing men than I am likely
ever to have. I do not object so much to the cynical and satirical
fables as to those in which momentous truths are taught by monkeys and
foxes.

But I love "The Jungle Book" and "Wild Animals I Have Known." I feel
a genuine interest in the animals themselves, because they are real
animals and not caricatures of men. One sympathizes with their loves and
hatreds, laughs over their comedies, and weeps over their tragedies. And
if they point a moral, it is so subtle that we are not conscious of it.

My mind opened naturally and joyously to a conception of antiquity.
Greece, ancient Greece, exercised a mysterious fascination over me. In
my fancy the pagan gods and goddesses still walked on earth and talked
face to face with men, and in my heart I secretly built shrines to those
I loved best. I knew and loved the whole tribe of nymphs and heroes
and demigods--no, not quite all, for the cruelty and greed of Medea and
Jason were too monstrous to be forgiven, and I used to wonder why
the gods permitted them to do wrong and then punished them for their
wickedness. And the mystery is still unsolved. I often wonder how

God can dumbness keep While Sin creeps grinning through His house of
Time.

It was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise. I was familiar with the
story of Troy before I read it in the original, and consequently I had
little difficulty in making the Greek words surrender their treasures
after I had passed the borderland of grammar. Great poetry, whether
written in Greek or in English, needs no other interpreter than a
responsive heart. Would that the host of those who make the great
works of the poets odious by their analysis, impositions and laborious
comments might learn this simple truth! It is not necessary that one
should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts
and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and
appreciate a fine poem. I know my learned professors have found greater
riches in the Iliad than I shall ever find; but I am not avaricious. I
am content that others should be wiser than I. But with all their wide
and comprehensive knowledge, they cannot measure their enjoyment of that
splendid epic, nor can I. When I read the finest passages of the Iliad,
I am conscious of a soul-sense that lifts me above the narrow, cramping
circumstances of my life. My physical limitations are forgotten--my
world lies upward, the length and the breadth and the sweep of the
heavens are mine!

My admiration for the Aeneid is not so great, but it is none the
less real. I read it as much as possible without the help of notes or
dictionary, and I always like to translate the episodes that please me
especially. The word-painting of Virgil is wonderful sometimes; but his
gods and men move through the scenes of passion and strife and pity and
love like the graceful figures in an Elizabethan mask, whereas in the
Iliad they give three leaps and go on singing. Virgil is serene and
lovely like a marble Apollo in the moonlight; Homer is a beautiful,
animated youth in the full sunlight with the wind in his hair.

How easy it is to fly on paper wings! From "Greek Heroes" to the Iliad
was no day's journey, nor was it altogether pleasant. One could have
traveled round the word many times while I trudged my weary way through
the labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries, or fell into those
dreadful pitfalls called examinations, set by schools and colleges for
the confusion of those who seek after knowledge. I suppose this sort of
Pilgrim's Progress was justified by the end; but it seemed interminable
to me, in spite of the pleasant surprises that met me now and then at a
turn in the road.

I began to read the Bible long before I could understand it. Now it
seems strange to me that there should have been a time when my spirit
was deaf to its wondrous harmonies; but I remember well a rainy Sunday
morning when, having nothing else to do, I begged my cousin to read me a
story out of the Bible. Although she did not think I should understand,
she began to spell into my hand the story of Joseph and his brothers.
Somehow it failed to interest me. The unusual language and repetition
made the story seem unreal and far away in the land of Canaan, and I
fell asleep and wandered off to the land of Nod, before the brothers
came with the coat of many colours unto the tent of Jacob and told their
wicked lie! I cannot understand why the stories of the Greeks should
have been so full of charm for me, and those of the Bible so devoid
of interest, unless it was that I had made the acquaintance of several
Greeks in Boston and been inspired by their enthusiasm for the stories
of their country; whereas I had not met a single Hebrew or Egyptian, and
therefore concluded that they were nothing more than barbarians, and the
stories about them were probably all made up, which hypothesis explained
the repetitions and the queer names. Curiously enough, it never occurred
to me to call Greek patronymics "queer."

But how shall I speak of the glories I have since discovered in the
Bible? For years I have read it with an ever-broadening sense of joy and
inspiration; and I love it as I love no other book. Still there is much
in the Bible against which every instinct of my being rebels, so much
that I regret the necessity which has compelled me to read it through
from beginning to end. I do not think that the knowledge which I have
gained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant
details it has forced upon my attention. For my part, I wish, with Mr.
Howells, that the literature of the past might be purged of all that is
ugly and barbarous in it, although I should object as much as any one to
having these great works weakened or falsified.

There is something impressive, awful, in the simplicity and terrible
directness of the book of Esther. Could there be anything more dramatic
than the scene in which Esther stands before her wicked lord? She knows
her life is in his hands; there is no one to protect her from his wrath.
Yet, conquering her woman's fear, she approaches him, animated by the
noblest patriotism, having but one thought: "If I perish, I perish; but
if I live, my people shall live."

The story of Ruth, too--how Oriental it is! Yet how different is the
life of these simple country folks from that of the Persian capital!
Ruth is so loyal and gentle-hearted, we cannot help loving her, as she
stands with the reapers amid the waving corn. Her beautiful, unselfish
spirit shines out like a bright star in the night of a dark and cruel
age. Love like Ruth's, love which can rise above conflicting creeds and
deep-seated racial prejudices, is hard to find in all the world.

The Bible gives me a deep, comforting sense that "things seen are
temporal, and things unseen are eternal."

I do not remember a time since I have been capable of loving books that
I have not loved Shakespeare. I cannot tell exactly when I began Lamb's
"Tales from Shakespeare"; but I know that I read them at first with
a child's understanding and a child's wonder. "Macbeth" seems to have
impressed me most. One reading was sufficient to stamp every detail of
the story upon my memory forever. For a long time the ghosts and witches
pursued me even into Dreamland. I could see, absolutely see, the dagger
and Lady Macbeth's little white hand--the dreadful stain was as real to
me as to the grief-stricken queen.

I read "King Lear" soon after "Macbeth," and I shall never forget the
feeling of horror when I came to the scene in which Gloster's eyes are
put out. Anger seized me, my fingers refused to move, I sat rigid for
one long moment, the blood throbbing in my temples, and all the hatred
that a child can feel concentrated in my heart.

I must have made the acquaintance of Shylock and Satan about the same
time, for the two characters were long associated in my mind. I remember
that I was sorry for them. I felt vaguely that they could not be good
even if they wished to, because no one seemed willing to help them or
to give them a fair chance. Even now I cannot find it in my heart to
condemn them utterly. There are moments when I feel that the Shylocks,
the Judases, and even the Devil, are broken spokes in the great wheel of
good which shall in due time be made whole.

It seems strange that my first reading of Shakespeare should have left
me so many unpleasant memories. The bright, gentle, fanciful plays--the
ones I like best now--appear not to have impressed me at first, perhaps
because they reflected the habitual sunshine and gaiety of a child's
life. But "there is nothing more capricious than the memory of a child:
what it will hold, and what it will lose."

I have since read Shakespeare's plays many times and know parts of them
by heart, but I cannot tell which of them I like best. My delight in
them is as varied as my moods. The little songs and the sonnets have a
meaning for me as fresh and wonderful as the dramas. But, with all my
love for Shakespeare, it is often weary work to read all the meanings
into his lines which critics and commentators have given them. I used
to try to remember their interpretations, but they discouraged and vexed
me; so I made a secret compact with myself not to try any more. This
compact I have only just broken in my study of Shakespeare under
Professor Kittredge. I know there are many things in Shakespeare, and
in the world, that I do not understand; and I am glad to see veil after
veil lift gradually, revealing new realms of thought and beauty.

Next to poetry I love history. I have read every historical work that
I have been able to lay my hands on, from a catalogue of dry facts and
dryer dates to Green's impartial, picturesque "History of the English
People"; from Freeman's "History of Europe" to Emerton's "Middle Ages."
The first book that gave me any real sense of the value of history was
Swinton's "World History," which I received on my thirteenth birthday.
Though I believe it is no longer considered valid, yet I have kept it
ever since as one of my treasures. From it I learned how the races of
men spread from land to land and built great cities, how a few great
rulers, earthly Titans, put everything under their feet, and with a
decisive word opened the gates of happiness for millions and closed them
upon millions more: how different nations pioneered in art and
knowledge and broke ground for the mightier growths of coming ages; how
civilization underwent as it were, the holocaust of a degenerate age,
and rose again, like the Phoenix, among the nobler sons of the North;
and how by liberty, tolerance and education the great and the wise have
opened the way for the salvation of the whole world.

In my college reading I have become somewhat familiar with French and
German literature. The German puts strength before beauty, and truth
before convention, both in life and in literature. There is a vehement,
sledge-hammer vigour about everything that he does. When he speaks, it
is not to impress others, but because his heart would burst if he did
not find an outlet for the thoughts that burn in his soul.

Then, too, there is in German literature a fine reserve which I like;
but its chief glory is the recognition I find in it of the redeeming
potency of woman's self-sacrificing love. This thought pervades all
German literature and is mystically expressed in Goethe's "Faust":

All things transitory But as symbols are sent. Earth's insufficiency
Here grows to event. The indescribable Here it is done. The Woman Soul
leads us upward and on!

Of all the French writers that I have read, I like Moliere and Racine
best. There are fine things in Balzac and passages in Merimee which
strike one like a keen blast of sea air. Alfred de Musset is impossible!
I admire Victor Hugo--I appreciate his genius, his brilliancy, his
romanticism; though he is not one of my literary passions. But Hugo
and Goethe and Schiller and all great poets of all great nations are
interpreters of eternal things, and my spirit reverently follows them
into the regions where Beauty and Truth and Goodness are one.

I am afraid I have written too much about my book-friends, and yet I
have mentioned only the authors I love most; and from this fact one
might easily suppose that my circle of friends was very limited and
undemocratic, which would be a very wrong impression. I like many
writers for many reasons--Carlyle for his ruggedness and scorn of
shams; Wordsworth, who teaches the oneness of man and nature; I find an
exquisite pleasure in the oddities and surprises of Hood, in Herrick's
quaintness and the palpable scent of lily and rose in his verses; I like
Whittier for his enthusiasms and moral rectitude. I knew him, and the
gentle remembrance of our friendship doubles the pleasure I have in
reading his poems. I love Mark Twain--who does not? The gods, too, loved
him and put into his heart all manner of wisdom; then, fearing lest he
should become a pessimist, they spanned his mind with a rainbow of love
and faith. I like Scott for his freshness, dash and large honesty. I
love all writers whose minds, like Lowell's, bubble up in the sunshine
of optimism--fountains of joy and good will, with occasionally a splash
of anger and here and there a healing spray of sympathy and pity.

In a word, literature is my Utopia. Here I am not disfranchised. No
barrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet, gracious discourse of
my book-friends. They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness.
The things I have learned and the things I have been taught seem of
ridiculously little importance compared with their "large loves and
heavenly charities."



CHAPTER XXII

I trust that my readers have not concluded from the preceding chapter on
books that reading is my only pleasure; my pleasures and amusements are
many and varied.

More than once in the course of my story I have referred to my love of
the country and out-of-door sports. When I was quite a little girl, I
learned to row and swim, and during the summer, when I am at Wrentham,
Massachusetts, I almost live in my boat. Nothing gives me greater
pleasure than to take my friends out rowing when they visit me. Of
course, I cannot guide the boat very well. Some one usually sits in
the stern and manages the rudder while I row. Sometimes, however, I go
rowing without the rudder. It is fun to try to steer by the scent of
watergrasses and lilies, and of bushes that grow on the shore. I use
oars with leather bands, which keep them in position in the oarlocks,
and I know by the resistance of the water when the oars are evenly
poised. In the same manner I can also tell when I am pulling against the
current. I like to contend with wind and wave. What is more exhilarating
than to make your staunch little boat, obedient to your will and muscle,
go skimming lightly over glistening, tilting waves, and to feel the
steady, imperious surge of the water!

I also enjoy canoeing, and I suppose you will smile when I say that I
especially like it on moonlight nights. I cannot, it is true, see the
moon climb up the sky behind the pines and steal softly across the
heavens, making a shining path for us to follow; but I know she is
there, and as I lie back among the pillows and put my hand in the water,
I fancy that I feel the shimmer of her garments as she passes. Sometimes
a daring little fish slips between my fingers, and often a pond-lily
presses shyly against my hand. Frequently, as we emerge from the shelter
of a cove or inlet, I am suddenly conscious of the spaciousness of the
air about me. A luminous warmth seems to enfold me. Whether it comes
from the trees which have been heated by the sun, or from the water, I
can never discover. I have had the same strange sensation even in the
heart of the city. I have felt it on cold, stormy days and at night. It
is like the kiss of warm lips on my face.

My favourite amusement is sailing. In the summer of 1901 I visited Nova
Scotia, and had opportunities such as I had not enjoyed before to make
the acquaintance of the ocean. After spending a few days in Evangeline's
country, about which Longfellow's beautiful poem has woven a spell of
enchantment, Miss Sullivan and I went to Halifax, where we remained the
greater part of the summer. The harbour was our joy, our paradise. What
glorious sails we had to Bedford Basin, to McNabb's Island, to York
Redoubt, and to the Northwest Arm! And at night what soothing, wondrous
hours we spent in the shadow of the great, silent men-of-war. Oh, it was
all so interesting, so beautiful! The memory of it is a joy forever.

One day we had a thrilling experience. There was a regatta in the
Northwest Arm, in which the boats from the different warships were
engaged. We went in a sail-boat along with many others to watch the
races. Hundreds of little sail-boats swung to and fro close by, and
the sea was calm. When the races were over, and we turned our faces
homeward, one of the party noticed a black cloud drifting in from the
sea, which grew and spread and thickened until it covered the whole sky.
The wind rose, and the waves chopped angrily at unseen barriers. Our
little boat confronted the gale fearlessly; with sails spread and ropes
taut, she seemed to sit upon the wind. Now she swirled in the billows,
now she spring upward on a gigantic wave, only to be driven down with
angry howl and hiss. Down came the mainsail. Tacking and jibbing,
we wrestled with opposing winds that drove us from side to side with
impetuous fury. Our hearts beat fast, and our hands trembled with
excitement, not fear, for we had the hearts of vikings, and we knew that
our skipper was master of the situation. He had steered through many
a storm with firm hand and sea-wise eye. As they passed us, the large
craft and the gunboats in the harbour saluted and the seamen shouted
applause for the master of the only little sail-boat that ventured out
into the storm. At last, cold, hungry and weary, we reached our pier.

Last summer I spent in one of the loveliest nooks of one of the most
charming villages in New England. Wrentham, Massachusetts, is associated
with nearly all of my joys and sorrows. For many years Red Farm, by King
Philip's Pond, the home of Mr. J. E. Chamberlin and his family, was
my home. I remember with deepest gratitude the kindness of these dear
friends and the happy days I spent with them. The sweet companionship
of their children meant much to me. I joined in all their sports and
rambles through the woods and frolics in the water. The prattle of the
little ones and their pleasure in the stories I told them of elf and
gnome, of hero and wily bear, are pleasant things to remember. Mr.
Chamberlin initiated me into the mysteries of tree and wild-flower,
until with the little ear of love I heard the flow of sap in the oak,
and saw the sun glint from leaf to leaf.

  Thus it is that
  Even as the roots, shut in the darksome earth,
  Share in the tree-top's joyance, and conceive
  Of sunshine and wide air and winged things,
  By sympathy of nature, so do
  I gave evidence of things unseen.

It seems to me that there is in each of us a capacity to comprehend the
impressions and emotions which have been experienced by mankind from the
beginning. Each individual has a subconscious memory of the green earth
and murmuring waters, and blindness and deafness cannot rob him of this
gift from past generations. This inherited capacity is a sort of sixth
sense--a soul-sense which sees, hears, feels, all in one.

I have many tree friends in Wrentham. One of them, a splendid oak, is
the special pride of my heart. I take all my other friends to see this
king-tree. It stands on a bluff overlooking King Philip's Pond, and
those who are wise in tree lore say it must have stood there eight
hundred or a thousand years. There is a tradition that under this tree
King Philip, the heroic Indian chief, gazed his last on earth and sky.

I had another tree friend, gentle and more approachable than the great
oak--a linden that grew in the dooryard at Red Farm. One afternoon,
during a terrible thunderstorm, I felt a tremendous crash against the
side of the house and knew, even before they told me, that the linden
had fallen. We went out to see the hero that had withstood so many
tempests, and it wrung my heart to see him prostrate who had mightily
striven and was now mightily fallen.

But I must not forget that I was going to write about last summer in
particular. As soon as my examinations were over, Miss Sullivan and I
hastened to this green nook, where we have a little cottage on one of
the three lakes for which Wrentham is famous. Here the long, sunny days
were mine, and all thoughts of work and college and the noisy city were
thrust into the background. In Wrentham we caught echoes of what was
happening in the world--war, alliance, social conflict. We heard of the
cruel, unnecessary fighting in the far-away Pacific, and learned of the
struggles going on between capital and labour. We knew that beyond the
border of our Eden men were making history by the sweat of their brows
when they might better make a holiday. But we little heeded these
things. These things would pass away; here were lakes and woods and
broad daisy-starred fields and sweet-breathed meadows, and they shall
endure forever.

People who think that all sensations reach us through the eye and the
ear have expressed surprise that I should notice any difference, except
possibly the absence of pavements, between walking in city streets
and in country roads. They forget that my whole body is alive to the
conditions about me. The rumble and roar of the city smite the nerves of
my face, and I feel the ceaseless tramp of an unseen multitude, and the
dissonant tumult frets my spirit. The grinding of heavy wagons on hard
pavements and the monotonous clangour of machinery are all the more
torturing to the nerves if one's attention is not diverted by the
panorama that is always present in the noisy streets to people who can
see.

In the country one sees only Nature's fair works, and one's soul is not
saddened by the cruel struggle for mere existence that goes on in the
crowded city. Several times I have visited the narrow, dirty streets
where the poor live, and I grow hot and indignant to think that good
people should be content to live in fine houses and become strong
and beautiful, while others are condemned to live in hideous, sunless
tenements and grow ugly, withered and cringing. The children who crowd
these grimy alleys, half-clad and underfed, shrink away from your
outstretched hand as if from a blow. Dear little creatures, they crouch
in my heart and haunt me with a constant sense of pain. There are men
and women, too, all gnarled and bent out of shape. I have felt their
hard, rough hands and realized what an endless struggle their existence
must be--no more than a series of scrimmages, thwarted attempts to do
something. Their life seems an immense disparity between effort and
opportunity. The sun and the air are God's free gifts to all we say, but
are they so? In yonder city's dingy alleys the sun shines not, and the
air is foul. Oh, man, how dost thou forget and obstruct thy brother man,
and say, "Give us this day our daily bread," when he has none! Oh, would
that men would leave the city, its splendour and its tumult and its
gold, and return to wood and field and simple, honest living! Then would
their children grow stately as noble trees, and their thoughts sweet and
pure as wayside flowers. It is impossible not to think of all this when
I return to the country after a year of work in town.

What a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once
more, to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks where I can bathe
my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes, or to clamber over a
stone wall into green fields that tumble and roll and climb in riotous
gladness!

Next to a leisurely walk I enjoy a "spin" on my tandem bicycle. It is
splendid to feel the wind blowing in my face and the springy motion of
my iron steed. The rapid rush through the air gives me a delicious sense
of strength and buoyancy, and the exercise makes my pulses dance and my
heart sing.

Whenever it is possible, my dog accompanies me on a walk or ride or
sail. I have had many dog friends--huge mastiffs, soft-eyed spaniels,
wood-wise setters and honest, homely bull terriers. At present the lord
of my affections is one of these bull terriers. He has a long pedigree,
a crooked tail and the drollest "phiz" in dogdom. My dog friends seem
to understand my limitations, and always keep close beside me when I
am alone. I love their affectionate ways and the eloquent wag of their
tails.

When a rainy day keeps me indoors, I amuse myself after the manner of
other girls. I like to knit and crochet; I read in the happy-go-lucky
way I love, here and there a line; or perhaps I play a game or two of
checkers or chess with a friend. I have a special board on which I play
these games. The squares are cut out, so that the men stand in them
firmly. The black checkers are flat and the white ones curved on top.
Each checker has a hole in the middle in which a brass knob can be
placed to distinguish the king from the commons. The chessmen are of
two sizes, the white larger than the black, so that I have no trouble
in following my opponent's maneuvers by moving my hands lightly over the
board after a play. The jar made by shifting the men from one hole to
another tells me when it is my turn.

If I happen to be all alone and in an idle mood, I play a game of
solitaire, of which I am very fond. I use playing cards marked in the
upper right-hand corner with braille symbols which indicate the value of
the card.

If there are children around, nothing pleases me so much as to frolic
with them. I find even the smallest child excellent company, and I am
glad to say that children usually like me. They lead me about and show
me the things they are interested in. Of course the little ones cannot
spell on their fingers; but I manage to read their lips. If I do not
succeed they resort to dumb show. Sometimes I make a mistake and do the
wrong thing. A burst of childish laughter greets my blunder, and the
pantomime begins all over again. I often tell them stories or teach them
a game, and the winged hours depart and leave us good and happy.

Museums and art stores are also sources of pleasure and inspiration.
Doubtless it will seem strange to many that the hand unaided by sight
can feel action, sentiment, beauty in the cold marble; and yet it is
true that I derive genuine pleasure from touching great works of art.
As my finger tips trace line and curve, they discover the thought and
emotion which the artist has portrayed. I can feel in the faces of gods
and heroes hate, courage and love, just as I can detect them in living
faces I am permitted to touch. I feel in Diana's posture the grace and
freedom of the forest and the spirit that tames the mountain lion
and subdues the fiercest passions. My soul delights in the repose and
gracious curves of the Venus; and in Barre's bronzes the secrets of the
jungle are revealed to me.

A medallion of Homer hangs on the wall of my study, conveniently low, so
that I can easily reach it and touch the beautiful, sad face with loving
reverence. How well I know each line in that majestic brow--tracks of
life and bitter evidences of struggle and sorrow; those sightless eyes
seeking, even in the cold plaster, for the light and the blue skies of
his beloved Hellas, but seeking in vain; that beautiful mouth, firm and
true and tender. It is the face of a poet, and of a man acquainted with
sorrow. Ah, how well I understand his deprivation--the perpetual night
in which he dwelt--

O dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon, Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse
Without all hope of day!

In imagination I can hear Homer singing, as with unsteady, hesitating
steps he gropes his way from camp to camp--singing of life, of love, of
war, of the splendid achievements of a noble race. It was a wonderful,
glorious song, and it won the blind poet an immortal crown, the
admiration of all ages.

I sometimes wonder if the hand is not more sensitive to the beauties of
sculpture than the eye. I should think the wonderful rhythmical flow of
lines and curves could be more subtly felt than seen. Be this as it may,
I know that I can feel the heart-throbs of the ancient Greeks in their
marble gods and goddesses.

Another pleasure, which comes more rarely than the others, is going to
the theatre. I enjoy having a play described to me while it is being
acted on the stage far more than reading it, because then it seems as if
I were living in the midst of stirring events. It has been my privilege
to meet a few great actors and actresses who have the power of so
bewitching you that you forget time and place and live again in the
romantic past. I have been permitted to touch the face and costume of
Miss Ellen Terry as she impersonated our ideal of a queen; and there was
about her that divinity that hedges sublimest woe. Beside her stood Sir
Henry Irving, wearing the symbols of kingship; and there was majesty of
intellect in his every gesture and attitude and the royalty that subdues
and overcomes in every line of his sensitive face. In the king's face,
which he wore as a mask, there was a remoteness and inaccessibility of
grief which I shall never forget.

I also know Mr. Jefferson. I am proud to count him among my friends. I
go to see him whenever I happen to be where he is acting. The first
time I saw him act was while at school in New York. He played "Rip Van
Winkle." I had often read the story, but I had never felt the charm of
Rip's slow, quaint, kind ways as I did in the play. Mr. Jefferson's,
beautiful, pathetic representation quite carried me away with delight.
I have a picture of old Rip in my fingers which they will never lose.
After the play Miss Sullivan took me to see him behind the scenes, and
I felt of his curious garb and his flowing hair and beard. Mr. Jefferson
let me touch his face so that I could imagine how he looked on waking
from that strange sleep of twenty years, and he showed me how poor old
Rip staggered to his feet.

I have also seen him in "The Rivals." Once while I was calling on him
in Boston he acted the most striking parts of "The Rivals" for me. The
reception-room where we sat served for a stage. He and his son seated
themselves at the big table, and Bob Acres wrote his challenge. I
followed all his movements with my hands, and caught the drollery of his
blunders and gestures in a way that would have been impossible had it
all been spelled to me. Then they rose to fight the duel, and I followed
the swift thrusts and parries of the swords and the waverings of poor
Bob as his courage oozed out at his finger ends. Then the great actor
gave his coat a hitch and his mouth a twitch, and in an instant I was in
the village of Falling Water and felt Schneider's shaggy head against my
knee. Mr. Jefferson recited the best dialogues of "Rip Van Winkle," in
which the tear came close upon the smile. He asked me to indicate as
far as I could the gestures and action that should go with the lines. Of
course, I have no sense whatever of dramatic action, and could make only
random guesses; but with masterful art he suited the action to the word.
The sigh of Rip as he murmurs, "Is a man so soon forgotten when he is
gone?" the dismay with which he searches for dog and gun after his
long sleep, and his comical irresolution over signing the contract with
Derrick--all these seem to be right out of life itself; that is, the
ideal life, where things happen as we think they should.

I remember well the first time I went to the theatre. It was twelve
years ago. Elsie Leslie, the little actress, was in Boston, and Miss
Sullivan took me to see her in "The Prince and the Pauper." I shall
never forget the ripple of alternating joy and woe that ran through that
beautiful little play, or the wonderful child who acted it. After the
play I was permitted to go behind the scenes and meet her in her royal
costume. It would have been hard to find a lovelier or more lovable
child than Elsie, as she stood with a cloud of golden hair floating over
her shoulders, smiling brightly, showing no signs of shyness or fatigue,
though she had been playing to an immense audience. I was only just
learning to speak, and had previously repeated her name until I could
say it perfectly. Imagine my delight when she understood the few words I
spoke to her and without hesitation stretched her hand to greet me.

Is it not true, then, that my life with all its limitations touches at
many points the life of the World Beautiful? Everything has its wonders,
even darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in,
therein to be content.

Sometimes, it is true, a sense of isolation enfolds me like a cold mist
as I sit alone and wait at life's shut gate. Beyond there is light,
and music, and sweet companionship; but I may not enter. Fate, silent,
pitiless, bars the way. Fain would I question his imperious decree, for
my heart is still undisciplined and passionate; but my tongue will not
utter the bitter, futile words that rise to my lips, and they fall back
into my heart like unshed tears. Silence sits immense upon my soul.
Then comes hope with a smile and whispers, "There is joy in
self-forgetfulness." So I try to make the light in others' eyes my sun,
the music in others' ears my symphony, the smile on others' lips my
happiness.



CHAPTER XXIII

Would that I could enrich this sketch with the names of all those who
have ministered to my happiness! Some of them would be found written
in our literature and dear to the hearts of many, while others would
be wholly unknown to most of my readers. But their influence, though it
escapes fame, shall live immortal in the lives that have been sweetened
and ennobled by it. Those are red-letter days in our lives when we meet
people who thrill us like a fine poem, people whose handshake is brimful
of unspoken sympathy, and whose sweet, rich natures impart to our eager,
impatient spirits a wonderful restfulness which, in its essence, is
divine. The perplexities, irritations and worries that have absorbed us
pass like unpleasant dreams, and we wake to see with new eyes and hear
with new ears the beauty and harmony of God's real world. The solemn
nothings that fill our everyday life blossom suddenly into bright
possibilities. In a word, while such friends are near us we feel that
all is well. Perhaps we never saw them before, and they may never cross
our life's path again; but the influence of their calm, mellow natures
is a libation poured upon our discontent, and we feel its healing touch,
as the ocean feels the mountain stream freshening its brine.

I have often been asked, "Do not people bore you?" I do not understand
quite what that means. I suppose the calls of the stupid and curious,
especially of newspaper reporters, are always inopportune. I also
dislike people who try to talk down to my understanding. They are like
people who when walking with you try to shorten their steps to suit
yours; the hypocrisy in both cases is equally exasperating.

The hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me. The touch of some
hands is an impertinence. I have met people so empty of joy, that when
I clasped their frosty finger tips, it seemed as if I were shaking hands
with a northeast storm. Others there are whose hands have sunbeams in
them, so that their grasp warms my heart. It may be only the clinging
touch of a child's hand; but there is as much potential sunshine in it
for me as there is in a loving glance for others. A hearty handshake or
a friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure.

I have many far-off friends whom I have never seen. Indeed they are so
many that I have often been unable to reply to their letters; but I
wish to say here that I am always grateful for their kind words, however
insufficiently I acknowledge them.

I count it one of the sweetest privileges of my life to have known and
conversed with many men of genius. Only those who knew Bishop Brooks can
appreciate the joy his friendship was to those who possessed it. As a
child I loved to sit on his knee and clasp his great hand with one of
mine, while Miss Sullivan spelled into the other his beautiful words
about God and the spiritual world. I heard him with a child's wonder
and delight. My spirit could not reach up to his, but he gave me a real
sense of joy in life, and I never left him without carrying away a fine
thought that grew in beauty and depth of meaning as I grew. Once, when I
was puzzled to know why there were so many religions, he said: "There is
one universal religion, Helen--the religion of love. Love your Heavenly
Father with your whole heart and soul, love every child of God as much
as ever you can, and remember that the possibilities of good are greater
than the possibilities of evil; and you have the key to Heaven." And
his life was a happy illustration of this great truth. In his noble
soul love and widest knowledge were blended with faith that had become
insight. He saw

     God in all that liberates and lifts,
     In all that humbles, sweetens and consoles.

Bishop Brooks taught me no special creed or dogma; but he impressed upon
my mind two great ideas--the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
man, and made me feel that these truths underlie all creeds and forms of
worship. God is love, God is our Father, we are His children; therefore
the darkest clouds will break and though right be worsted, wrong shall
not triumph.

I am too happy in this world to think much about the future, except
to remember that I have cherished friends awaiting me there in God's
beautiful Somewhere. In spite of the lapse of years, they seem so close
to me that I should not think it strange if at any moment they should
clasp my hand and speak words of endearment as they used to before they
went away.

Since Bishop Brooks died I have read the Bible through; also some
philosophical works on religion, among them Swedenborg's "Heaven and
Hell" and Drummond's "Ascent of Man," and I have found no creed or
system more soul-satisfying than Bishop Brooks's creed of love. I knew
Mr. Henry Drummond, and the memory of his strong, warm hand-clasp is
like a benediction. He was the most sympathetic of companions. He knew
so much and was so genial that it was impossible to feel dull in his
presence.

I remember well the first time I saw Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. He had
invited Miss Sullivan and me to call on him one Sunday afternoon. It was
early in the spring, just after I had learned to speak. We were shown
at once to his library where we found him seated in a big armchair by an
open fire which glowed and crackled on the hearth, thinking, he said, of
other days.

"And listening to the murmur of the River Charles," I suggested.

"Yes," he replied, "the Charles has many dear associations for me."
There was an odour of print and leather in the room which told me that
it was full of books, and I stretched out my hand instinctively to find
them. My fingers lighted upon a beautiful volume of Tennyson's poems,
and when Miss Sullivan told me what it was I began to recite:

Break, break, break On thy cold gray stones, O sea!

But I stopped suddenly. I felt tears on my hand. I had made my beloved
poet weep, and I was greatly distressed. He made me sit in his armchair,
while he brought different interesting things for me to examine, and
at his request I recited "The Chambered Nautilus," which was then my
favorite poem. After that I saw Dr. Holmes many times and learned to
love the man as well as the poet.

One beautiful summer day, not long after my meeting with Dr. Holmes,
Miss Sullivan and I visited Whittier in his quiet home on the Merrimac.
His gentle courtesy and quaint speech won my heart. He had a book of
his poems in raised print from which I read "In School Days." He was
delighted that I could pronounce the words so well, and said that he had
no difficulty in understanding me. Then I asked many questions about the
poem, and read his answers by placing my fingers on his lips. He said he
was the little boy in the poem, and that the girl's name was Sally, and
more which I have forgotten. I also recited "Laus Deo," and as I spoke
the concluding verses, he placed in my hands a statue of a slave from
whose crouching figure the fetters were falling, even as they fell from
Peter's limbs when the angel led him forth out of prison. Afterward we
went into his study, and he wrote his autograph for my teacher ["With
great admiration of thy noble work in releasing from bondage the mind of
thy dear pupil, I am truly thy friend. john J. Whittier."] and expressed
his admiration of her work, saying to me, "She is thy spiritual
liberator." Then he led me to the gate and kissed me tenderly on my
forehead. I promised to visit him again the following summer, but he
died before the promise was fulfilled.

Dr. Edward Everett Hale is one of my very oldest friends. I have known
him since I was eight, and my love for him has increased with my years.
His wise, tender sympathy has been the support of Miss Sullivan and me
in times of trial and sorrow, and his strong hand has helped us over
many rough places; and what he has done for us he has done for thousands
of those who have difficult tasks to accomplish. He has filled the old
skins of dogma with the new wine of love, and shown men what it is to
believe, live and be free. What he has taught we have seen beautifully
expressed in his own life--love of country, kindness to the least of his
brethren, and a sincere desire to live upward and onward. He has been
a prophet and an inspirer of men, and a mighty doer of the Word, the
friend of all his race--God bless him!

I have already written of my first meeting with Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell. Since then I have spent many happy days with him at Washington and
at his beautiful home in the heart of Cape Breton Island, near Baddeck,
the village made famous by Charles Dudley Warner's book. Here in Dr.
Bell's laboratory, or in the fields on the shore of the great Bras d'Or,
I have spent many delightful hours listening to what he had to tell me
about his experiments, and helping him fly kites by means of which he
expects to discover the laws that shall govern the future air-ship. Dr.
Bell is proficient in many fields of science, and has the art of making
every subject he touches interesting, even the most abstruse theories.
He makes you feel that if you only had a little more time, you, too,
might be an inventor. He has a humorous and poetic side, too. His
dominating passion is his love for children. He is never quite so happy
as when he has a little deaf child in his arms. His labours in behalf of
the deaf will live on and bless generations of children yet to come; and
we love him alike for what he himself has achieved and for what he has
evoked from others.

During the two years I spent in New York I had many opportunities to
talk with distinguished people whose names I had often heard, but whom I
had never expected to meet. Most of them I met first in the house of my
good friend, Mr. Laurence Hutton. It was a great privilege to visit him
and dear Mrs. Hutton in their lovely home, and see their library and
read the beautiful sentiments and bright thoughts gifted friends had
written for them. It has been truly said that Mr. Hutton has the faculty
of bringing out in every one the best thoughts and kindest sentiments.
One does not need to read "A Boy I Knew" to understand him--the most
generous, sweet-natured boy I ever knew, a good friend in all sorts of
weather, who traces the footprints of love in the life of dogs as well
as in that of his fellowmen.

Mrs. Hutton is a true and tried friend. Much that I hold sweetest, much
that I hold most precious, I owe to her. She has oftenest advised
and helped me in my progress through college. When I find my work
particularly difficult and discouraging, she writes me letters that make
me feel glad and brave; for she is one of those from whom we learn that
one painful duty fulfilled makes the next plainer and easier.

Mr. Hutton introduced me to many of his literary friends, greatest of
whom are Mr. William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. I also met Mr. Richard
Watson Gilder and Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman. I also knew Mr. Charles
Dudley Warner, the most delightful of story-tellers and the most beloved
friend, whose sympathy was so broad that it may be truly said of him,
he loved all living things and his neighbour as himself. Once Mr. Warner
brought to see me the dear poet of the woodlands--Mr. John Burroughs.
They were all gentle and sympathetic and I felt the charm of their
manner as much as I had felt the brilliancy of their essays and poems.
I could not keep pace with all these literary folk as they glanced from
subject to subject and entered into deep dispute, or made conversation
sparkle with epigrams and happy witticisms. I was like little Ascanius,
who followed with unequal steps the heroic strides of Aeneas on his
march toward mighty destinies. But they spoke many gracious words to me.
Mr. Gilder told me about his moonlight journeys across the vast desert
to the Pyramids, and in a letter he wrote me he made his mark under his
signature deep in the paper so that I could feel it. This reminds me
that Dr. Hale used to give a personal touch to his letters to me by
pricking his signature in braille. I read from Mark Twain's lips one
or two of his good stories. He has his own way of thinking, saying and
doing everything. I feel the twinkle of his eye in his handshake. Even
while he utters his cynical wisdom in an indescribably droll voice, he
makes you feel that his heart is a tender Iliad of human sympathy.

There are a host of other interesting people I met in New York: Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge, the beloved editor of St. Nicholas, and Mrs. Riggs
(Kate Douglas Wiggin), the sweet author of "Patsy." I received from them
gifts that have the gentle concurrence of the heart, books containing
their own thoughts, soul-illumined letters, and photographs that I love
to have described again and again. But there is not space to mention
all my friends, and indeed there are things about them hidden behind the
wings of cherubim, things too sacred to set forth in cold print. It is
with hesitancy that I have spoken even of Mrs. Laurence Hutton.

I shall mention only two other friends. One is Mrs. William Thaw, of
Pittsburgh, whom I have often visited in her home, Lyndhurst. She is
always doing something to make some one happy, and her generosity and
wise counsel have never failed my teacher and me in all the years we
have known her.

To the other friend I am also deeply indebted. He is well known for the
powerful hand with which he guides vast enterprises, and his wonderful
abilities have gained for him the respect of all. Kind to every one, he
goes about doing good, silent and unseen. Again I touch upon the circle
of honoured names I must not mention; but I would fain acknowledge his
generosity and affectionate interest which make it possible for me to go
to college.

Thus it is that my friends have made the story of my life. In a thousand
ways they have turned my limitations into beautiful privileges,
and enabled me to walk serene and happy in the shadow cast by my
deprivation.

II. LETTERS(1887-1901)




INTRODUCTION

Helen Keller's letters are important, not only as a supplementary
story of her life, but as a demonstration of her growth in
thought and expression--the growth which in itself has made her
distinguished.

These letters are, however, not merely remarkable as the
productions of a deaf and blind girl, to be read with wonder and
curiosity; they are good letters almost from the first. The best
passages are those in which she talks about herself, and gives
her world in terms of her experience of it. Her views on the
precession of the equinoxes are not important, but most important
are her accounts of what speech meant to her, of how she felt the
statues, the dogs, the chickens at the poultry show, and how she
stood in the aisle of St. Bartholomew's and felt the organ
rumble. Those are passages of which one would ask for more. The
reason they are comparatively few is that all her life she has
been trying to be "like other people," and so she too often
describes things not as they appear to her, but as they appear to
one with eyes and ears.

One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number
of them. They are the exercises which have trained her to write.
She has lived at different times in different parts of the
country, and so has been separated from most of her friends and
relatives. Of her friends, many have been distinguished people,
to whom--not often, I think, at the sacrifice of spontaneity--she
has felt it necessary to write well. To them and to a few friends
with whom she is in closest sympathy she writes with intimate
frankness whatever she is thinking about. Her naive retelling of
a child's tale she has heard, like the story of "Little Jakey,"
which she rehearses for Dr. Holmes and Bishop Brooks, is charming
and her grave paraphrase of the day's lesson in geography or
botany, her parrot-like repetition of what she has heard, and her
conscious display of new words, are delightful and instructive;
for they show not only what she was learning, but how, by putting
it all into letters, she made the new knowledge and the new words
her own.

So these selections from Miss Keller's correspondence are made
with two purposes--to show her development and to preserve the
most entertaining and significant passages from several hundred
letters. Many of those written before 1892 were published in the
reports of the Perkins Institution for the Blind. All letters up
to that year are printed intact, for it is legitimate to be
interested in the degree of skill the child showed in writing,
even to details of punctuation; so it is well to preserve a
literal integrity of reproduction. From the letters after the
year 1892 I have culled in the spirit of one making an anthology,
choosing the passages best in style and most important from the
point of view of biography. Where I have been able to collate the
original letters I have preserved everything as Miss Keller wrote
it, punctuation, spelling, and all. I have done nothing but
select and cut.

The letters are arranged in chronological order. One or two
letters from Bishop Brooks, Dr. Holmes, and Whittier are put
immediately after the letters to which they are replies. Except
for two or three important letters of 1901, these selections
cease with the year 1900. In that year Miss Keller entered
college. Now that she is a grown woman, her mature letters should
be judged like those of any other person, and it seems best that
no more of her correspondence be published unless she should
become distinguished beyond the fact that she is the only
well-educated deaf and blind person in the world.




  LETTERS (1887-1901)

  Miss Sullivan began to teach Helen Keller on March 3rd, 1887.
  Three months and a half after the first word was spelled into her
  hand, she wrote in pencil this letter

  TO HER COUSIN ANNA, MRS. GEORGE T. TURNER
  [Tuscumbia, Alabama, June 17, 1887.]

  helen write anna george will give helen apple simpson will shoot
  bird jack will give helen stick of candy doctor will give mildred
  medicine mother will make mildred new dress
  [No signature]


  Twenty-five days later, while she was on a short visit away from
  home, she wrote to her mother. Two words are almost illegible,
  and the angular print slants in every direction.

  TO MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER
  [Huntsville, Alabama, July 12, 1887.]

  Helen will write mother letter papa did give helen medicine
  mildred will sit in swing mildred did kiss helen teacher did give

  hat helen will hug and kiss mother helen will come home

  good-by
  [No signature.]


  By the following September Helen shows improvement in fulness of
  construction and more extended relations of thought.

  TO THE BLIND GIRLS AT THE PERKINS INSTITUTION IN SOUTH BOSTON
  [Tuscumbia, September, 1887.]

  Helen will write little blind girls a letter Helen and teacher
  will come to see little blind girls Helen and teacher will go in

  hand teacher does whip handee to go fast Helen is blind Helen
  will put letter in envelope for blind girls     good-by
  HELEN KELLER


  A few weeks later her style is more nearly correct and freer in
  movement. She improves in idiom, although she still omits
  articles and uses the "did" construction for the simple past.
  This is an idiom common among children.

  TO THE BLIND GIRLS AT THE PERKINS INSTITUTION
  [Tuscumbia, October 24, 1887.]

  dear little blind girls

  TO DR. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
  [Tuscumbia, November, 1887.]

  Dear Mr. Bell.

  and Father and aunt did go to see you in Washington. I did play
  with your watch. I do love you. I saw doctor in Washington. He

  doll. Father will buy me lovely new watch. Cousin Anna gave me a
  pretty doll. Her name is Allie.

  Good-by,
  HELEN KELLER.


  By the beginning of the next year her idioms are firmer. More
  adjectives appear, including adjectives of colour. Although she
  can have no sensuous knowledge of colour, she can use the words,
  as we use most of our vocabulary, intellectually, with truth, not
  to impression, but to fact. This letter is to a school-mate at
  the Perkins Institution.

  TO MISS SARAH TOMLINSON
  Tuscumbia, Ala. Jan. 2nd 1888.

  Dear Sarah
  I am happy to write to you this morning. I hope Mr. Anagnos is
  coming to see me soon. I will go to Boston in June and I will buy
  father gloves, and James nice collar, and Simpson cuffs. I saw
  Miss Betty and her scholars. They had a pretty Christmas-tree,
  and there were many pretty presents on it for little children. I
  had a mug, and little bird and candy. I had many lovely things
  for Christmas. Aunt gave me a trunk for Nancy and clothes. I went
  to party with teacher and mother. We did dance and play and eat
  nuts and candy and cakes and oranges and I did have fun with
  little boys and girls. Mrs. Hopkins did send me lovely ring, I do
  love her and little blind girls.

  Men and boys do make carpets in mills. Wool grows on sheep. Men
  do cut sheep's wool off with large shears, and send it to the
  mill. Men and women do make wool cloth in mills.

  Cotton grows on large stalks in fields. Men and boys and girls
  and women do pick cotton. We do make thread and cotton dresses of
  cotton. Cotton has pretty white and red flowers on it. Teacher
  did tear her dress. Mildred does cry. I will nurse Nancy. Mother
  will buy me lovely new aprons and dress to take to Boston. I went
  to Knoxville with father and aunt. Bessie is weak and little.
  Mrs. Thompson's chickens killed Leila's chickens. Eva does sleep
  in my bed. I do love good girls.

  Good-by
  HELEN KELLER.


  The next two letters mention her visit in January to her
  relatives in Memphis, Tennessee. She was taken to the cotton
  exchange. When she felt the maps and blackboards she asked, "Do
  men go to school?" She wrote on the blackboard the names of all
  the gentlemen present. While at Memphis she went over one of the
  large Mississippi steamers.


  TO DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE
  Tuscumbia, Alabama, February 15th [1888].

  Dear Mr. Hale,
  I am happy to write you a letter this morning. Teacher told me
  about kind gentleman I shall be glad to read pretty story I do

  Good bye
  HELEN KELLER.


  "Uncle Morrie" of the next letter is Mr. Morrison Heady, of
  Normandy, Kentucky, who lost his sight and hearing when he was a
  boy. He is the author of some commendable verses.

  TO MR. MORRISON HEADY
